## Getting Started

QuickMUD is a modern Python implementation of ROM 2.4b6, one of the most popular MUD engines ever created. This guide will help you install, run, and play QuickMUD.

### What is a MUD?

A **Multi-User Dungeon (MUD)** is a text-based multiplayer online role-playing game. Players explore a virtual world by reading descriptions and typing commands like:

```
> look
You are standing in the Temple of Midgaard.
A large fountain is here, with water bubbling up from it.
Exits: north south east west

> north
You walk north.
The Main Street of Midgaard
You are standing on the main street of Midgaard.
Exits: north south
```

### Why QuickMUD?

- ✅ **100% ROM 2.4b Behavioral Parity** - Authentic ROM experience
- ✅ **Modern Python** - Easy to install and extend
- ✅ **Active Development** - Regular updates and bug fixes
- ✅ **Cross-Platform** - Runs on Windows, Mac, Linux
- ✅ **JSON World Data** - Easy-to-edit area files

```

**Mac/Linux:**
```bash
telnet mud.example.com 4000
```

## Combat System

QuickMUD uses the classic ROM combat system with 100% behavioral parity to the original.

### How Combat Works

1. **Initiate combat** with `kill <target>`
2. **Automatic rounds** - attacks happen automatically each round
3. **Use skills** - type skill names during combat
4. **Monitor HP** - watch your health
5. **Flee if needed** - use `flee` to escape

### Combat Example

```
> kill orc
You attack an orc!

You hit an orc. (12 damage)
An orc misses you.

You massacre an orc! (24 damage)
An orc hits you. (8 damage)

> bash
You slam into an orc with your shield!
An orc falls to the ground, stunned!

You DEMOLISH an orc! (31 damage)
An orc is DEAD!!
You receive 150 experience points.

The corpse of an orc contains:
  some gold coins
  a rusty sword
```

### Death and Resurrection

If you die:

1. **You lose experience** (10% of current level)
2. **Corpse created** with your equipment
3. **Sent to recall** (Temple of Midgaard)
4. **Can recover corpse** by returning to death location

### PvP (Player vs Player)

- Use `murder <player>` instead of `kill`
- Only works in designated PvP areas
- Subject to server rules and penalties

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Connect to Server

**Problem**: "Connection refused" or timeout

**Solutions**:
1. Verify server is running (`ps aux | grep mud`)
2. Check firewall settings (allow port 4000)
3. Verify host/port configuration
4. Try localhost: `telnet localhost 4000`

### Character Won't Load

**Problem**: "Character not found" or load fails

**Solutions**:
1. Check case-sensitivity of name
2. Verify `data/players/` directory exists
3. Check file permissions
4. Look for error messages in server log

### Commands Not Working

**Problem**: "Huh?" or command not recognized

**Solutions**:
1. Check for typos
2. Use `help commands` for command list
3. Ensure sufficient level for command
4. Check if in correct mode (combat/peaceful)

### Server Crashes

**Problem**: Server exits unexpectedly

**Solutions**:
1. Check `server.log` for error messages
2. Verify Python version (3.10+ required)
3. Update to latest version: `pip install --upgrade quickmud`
4. Report bug with error log to GitHub issues

### Performance Issues

**Problem**: Lag or slow responses

**Solutions**:
1. Check server resources (CPU/RAM)
2. Reduce MAX_PLAYERS if needed
3. Optimize area resets
4. Enable logging only for errors: `LOG_LEVEL=ERROR`

### Data Corruption

**Problem**: Corrupted player files or areas

**Solutions**:
1. Restore from backup
2. Delete corrupt file (will lose that character)
3. Validate JSON files: `python -m json.tool data/areas/midgaard.json`
4. Report issue to GitHub
