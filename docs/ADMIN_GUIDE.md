| **58** | Deity | World modification, player management |
| **57** | Angel | Player assistance, limited building |
| **56** | Demi | Helper immortal, basic commands |
| **52+** | Immortal | Visible as staff, basic immortal commands |
| **51** | Hero | Max mortal level |

---

## Installation & Setup

### Initial Server Setup

```bash
# Install QuickMUD
pip install quickmud

# Create server directory
mkdir my-mud-server
cd my-mud-server

# Initialize server (creates data directories)
mud init

# Start server
mud runserver
```

### Directory Structure

```
my-mud-server/
├── data/
│   ├── areas/          # World area files (JSON)
│   ├── players/        # Player save files
│   ├── help.json       # Help system data

├── .env                # Configuration
└── mud.db         # SQLite database
```

### Creating First Immortal

**Method 1: From Player Account**

```bash
# Connect as player, then from server console:
python -c "from mud.models.character import character_registry; \
           from mud.world.world_state import initialize_world; \
           initialize_world(); \
           char = character_registry.get('YourName'); \
           char.level = 60; \
           char.trust = 60; \
           print(f'{char.name} is now Implementor!')"
```

**Method 2: Database Direct Edit** (SQLite)

```bash
sqlite3 mud.db
UPDATE characters SET level = 60, trust = 60 WHERE name = 'YourName';
.quit
```

**Method 3: Player File Edit** (JSON)

```bash
# Edit data/players/YourName
{
  "name": "YourName",
  "level": 60,
  "trust": 60,
  ...
}
```

---

## Immortal Levels

### Level Hierarchy

QuickMUD uses ROM's traditional immortal level system:

```
Level 60 - Implementor    (Full control)
Level 59 - God            (World management)
Level 58 - Deity          (Player management)
Level 57 - Angel          (Helper immortal)
Level 56 - Demi           (Basic immortal)
Level 52-55 - Immortal    (Visible staff)
Level 51 - Hero           (Max mortal)
```

### Setting Trust Levels

Trust level determines what commands an immortal can use, even if their character level is lower:

```
# As Implementor (level 60)
advance <player> <level>      # Set character level
trust <player> <level>        # Set trust level (command access)

# Examples
advance Gandalf 57            # Make Gandalf level 57 (Angel)
trust Gandalf 58              # Give Gandalf Deity-level commands
```

### Immortal Visibility

```
# Toggle invisibility
invis                         # Toggle immortal invisibility
invis <level>                 # Invisible to mortals below level

# Wizilist
wizlist                       # Show all immortals
```

## Security & Access Control

### Trust System

Trust levels control command access independently of character level:

```bash
# Check trust
pstat <player>                # Shows trust level

# Set trust
trust <player> <level>        # Grant command access
trust gandalf 57              # Angel-level commands

# Trust recommendations
# Level 60 - Only head admin
# Level 59 - Senior builders
# Level 58 - Player moderators
# Level 57 - Helper immortals
# Level 56 - Trial immortals
```

### Access Control

```bash
# Wizlock (immortals only)
wizlock                       # Toggle wizlock
wizlock on                    # Lock to immortals
wizlock off                   # Open to all

# Newlock (no new characters)
newlock                       # Toggle newlock
newlock on                    # Prevent new chars
newlock off                   # Allow new chars

# Site banning
ban <pattern>                 # Ban IP/hostname
ban 192.168.1.*               # Ban subnet
ban *.badsite.com             # Ban domain
ban list                      # Show bans
allow <site>                  # Remove ban
```

### Audit Logging

```bash
# Command logging
log all                       # Log all commands
log <player>                  # Log specific player
log stop                      # Stop logging

# Log files
tail -f log/server.log        # Monitor server log
grep "ADMIN" log/server.log   # Search admin actions
```

---

## Monitoring & Logging

### Server Monitoring

```bash
# Status commands
users                         # Connection info
lag                           # Server lag check
memory                        # Memory usage (if available)

# Performance
dump                          # List all objects
list                          # List areas
wizlist                       # List immortals
```

### Log Files

**log/server.log** - Main server log

```bash
# Monitor live
tail -f log/server.log

# Search logs
grep ERROR log/server.log
grep "player login" log/server.log
grep ADMIN log/server.log
```

**Log Levels** (configured in .env):

```bash
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG    # Verbose (development)
LOG_LEVEL=INFO     # Normal (default)
LOG_LEVEL=WARNING  # Warnings only
LOG_LEVEL=ERROR    # Errors only
```

### Admin Logging

All immortal commands are logged with:
- **Timestamp**
- **Immortal name**
- **Command executed**
- **Target (if applicable)**

Example log entry:
```
2025-12-22 15:30:45 [ADMIN] Gandalf (60) used: goto midgaard
2025-12-22 15:31:12 [ADMIN] Gandalf (60) used: advance Frodo 10
```

## Backup & Recovery

### Automatic Backups

QuickMUD saves player data automatically:
- **On quit** - Player saves when logging out
- **Every 30 minutes** - Auto-save for all online players
- **On shutdown** - All players saved before shutdown

### Manual Backups

```bash
# Force save all players
save

# Backup script (Linux/Mac)
#!/bin/bash
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)
tar -czf backups/mud_backup_$DATE.tar.gz data/ mud.db
find backups/ -mtime +30 -delete  # Remove backups older than 30 days
```

### Restore from Backup

```bash
# Stop server first!
tar -xzf backups/mud_backup_20251222_153000.tar.gz

# Restart server
mud runserver
```

### Player File Recovery

Player files are in `data/players/<name>` (JSON format):

```bash
# View player file
cat data/players/Gandalf

# Restore corrupt player
cp backups/players/Gandalf data/players/Gandalf

# Delete broken character (last resort)
rm data/players/BrokenChar
```

---

## Performance Tuning

### Server Configuration

**.env file:**

```bash
# Connection limits
MAX_PLAYERS=100                # Max concurrent players
CONNECTION_TIMEOUT=300         # Idle timeout (seconds)

# Performance
TICK_RATE=60                   # Game ticks per minute
SAVE_INTERVAL=1800             # Auto-save interval (seconds)

# Database
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///mud.db
DATABASE_POOL_SIZE=10

# Logging
LOG_LEVEL=INFO                 # INFO, WARNING, ERROR, DEBUG
LOG_FILE=log/server.log
```

### Resource Limits

```bash
# Monitor memory
top                            # Watch memory usage
ps aux | grep mud              # Find MUD process

# Limit resources (systemd)
MemoryLimit=512M
CPUQuota=50%
```

### Optimization Tips

1. **Reduce log verbosity** in production
2. **Clean old player files** (inactive > 1 year)
3. **Optimize area resets** (don't over-populate)
4. **Use connection limits** to prevent overload
5. **Monitor disk space** for databases

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Server Won't Start

```bash
# Check for port conflicts
netstat -an | grep 4000
lsof -i :4000

# Check permissions
ls -la data/
chmod 755 data/

# Check Python version
python --version  # Must be 3.10+
```

#### Player Can't Log In

```bash
# Check player file
cat data/players/PlayerName

# Check logs
grep "PlayerName" log/server.log

# Restore from backup if corrupt
cp backups/players/PlayerName data/players/
```

#### OLC Changes Not Saving

```bash
# Explicit save
asave changed

# Check file permissions
ls -la data/areas/
chmod 644 data/areas/*.json

# Check disk space
df -h
```

#### Performance Degradation

```bash
# Check online players
who

# Check object/mob count
dump | wc -l

# Purge unused objects
purge

# Restart server (saves everyone first)
shutdown 5
```

### Emergency Procedures

#### Server Crash Recovery

```bash
# 1. Check for core dump
ls -la core*

# 2. Review logs
tail -100 log/server.log

# 3. Restore from backup if needed
tar -xzf backups/latest.tar.gz

# 4. Restart server
mud runserver
```

#### Database Corruption

```bash
# SQLite recovery
sqlite3 mud.db
.integrity_check
.quit

# If corrupt, restore from backup
cp backups/mud.db mud.db
```

---

## Systemd Service

For production deployment, use systemd:

**/etc/systemd/system/quickmud.service:**

```ini
[Unit]
Description=QuickMUD Server
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=mudadmin
WorkingDirectory=/home/mudadmin/quickmud
Environment="PATH=/home/mudadmin/quickmud/venv/bin"
ExecStart=/home/mudadmin/quickmud/venv/bin/mud runserver
Restart=always
RestartSec=10

# Resource limits
MemoryLimit=512M
CPUQuota=50%

# Logging
StandardOutput=append:/var/log/quickmud/server.log
StandardError=append:/var/log/quickmud/error.log

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

**Enable and start:**

```bash
sudo systemctl enable quickmud
sudo systemctl start quickmud
sudo systemctl status quickmud

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u quickmud -f
```

---

## Best Practices

### Security

1. **Never share Implementor access** - Only 1-2 trusted admins
2. **Use trust levels appropriately** - Don't over-promote
3. **Monitor admin logs regularly** - Check for abuse
4. **Backup frequently** - Daily automated backups minimum
5. **Keep server updated** - `pip install --upgrade quickmud`

### World Building

1. **Plan vnums** - Reserve ranges (10000-19999 = Area1, etc.)
2. **Test thoroughly** - Use test characters before release
3. **Document changes** - Comment in area files
4. **Version control** - Use git for area files
5. **Coordinate builders** - Assign vnum ranges to prevent conflicts

### Player Management

1. **Be fair and consistent** - Apply rules equally
2. **Warn before punishment** - Give players chances
3. **Document incidents** - Keep notes on problem players
4. **Respond to reports** - Address player concerns quickly
5. **Foster community** - Encourage positive gameplay
