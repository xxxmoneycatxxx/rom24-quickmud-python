## Executive Summary

act_obj.c contains all ROM 2.4b6 object manipulation commands. This is a **P1 PRIORITY** file for ROM parity as it handles:
- Object retrieval (get, steal)
- Object placement (put, drop, give)
- Equipment (wear, remove)
- Consumables (quaff, recite, eat, drink, fill, pour)
- Shop interactions (buy, sell, list, value)
- Special commands (envenom, sacrifice, brandish, zap)

**Function Count**: 24 command functions + 5 helper functions = **29 total functions**

**Current Estimated Parity**: **100% overall**; all 12 audited object-command surfaces are complete and verified.

**Current State**:
- All tracked `GET-*`, `PUT-*`, `WEAR-*`, and `STEAL-*` gaps are closed.
- Consumables and magic-item command coverage (`quaff`, `drink`, `eat`, `fill`, `pour`, `recite`, `brandish`, `zap`) is complete.
- The detailed sections below include preserved historical phase notes from earlier audit passes; the status lines above and the per-command summaries are canonical.

## Detailed Function List

### 1. Object Retrieval Commands (P0 - CRITICAL)

| ROM C Function | Lines | QuickMUD | Status | Notes |
|----------------|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| `do_get()` | 195-344 | ✅ `inventory.py::do_get()` (line 142) | ✅ **AUDITED** | GET-001..012 fixed in prior sessions; 60/60 integration tests passing across `test_container_retrieval.py`, `test_furniture_occupancy.py`, `test_get_room_messages.py`, `test_numbered_get_syntax.py`, `test_pit_timer_handling.py`, `test_room_retrieval.py`. Verified April 27, 2026. **GET-014 ✅ FIXED (2.14.55):** the carry-limit messages (`"…: you can't carry that many items./much weight."`) baked the **full** `obj.name` keyword string with no capitalization. ROM `act("$d: you can't carry that many items.", ch, NULL, obj->name, TO_CHAR)` renders `$d` = the **first keyword** of `obj->name` and caps buf[0] — e.g. obj name "relic ancient" → "Relic: …", not "relic ancient: …". (This was the long-standing ⚠️ SIMILAR row in the comparison table below.) Rendered both via `act_format("$d: …", recipient=char, actor=char, arg2=obj.name)`. Test: `tests/test_encumbrance.py::test_get014_carry_limit_message_uses_first_keyword_capitalized`. **GET-015 ✅ FIXED (2.14.218):** the `get all <pit>` greed gate hardcoded `char_trust >= 51` ("IMMORTAL level" — wrong), so a level/trust-51 **mortal hero** was treated as immortal and could empty a donation pit. ROM gates on `!IS_IMMORTAL(ch)` (`src/act_obj.c:320-321`); `IS_IMMORTAL = get_trust(ch) >= LEVEL_IMMORTAL` and `LEVEL_IMMORTAL = MAX_LEVEL-8 = 52` (`src/merc.h:149,2091`) — 51 is `LEVEL_HERO`, the top mortal tier. Fixed to compare `>= LEVEL_IMMORTAL`. The prior `test_immortal_can_get_all_from_pit` encoded the misread (`char.trust = 51 # ROM: god = 51`) and was corrected to trust 52; added `test_hero_trust_51_mortal_cannot_get_all_from_pit` (RED→GREEN) in `tests/integration/test_container_retrieval.py`. **GET-016 ✅ FIXED (2.14.253):** the command-local `_get_obj_weight` helper (`mud/commands/inventory.py`, used by do_get's `can_carry_w` gate; also its twin in `mud/commands/obj_manipulation.py` used by do_put's "It won't fit" check) recursed into contents WITHOUT ROM's `WEIGHT_MULT` factor. ROM `get_obj_weight` (`src/handler.c`) does `weight += get_obj_weight(tobj) * WEIGHT_MULT(obj) / 100` where `WEIGHT_MULT = value[4]` for a container else 100 (`merc.h:2137`), so a magic bag (`value[4]=50`) holding a 100-lb item weighs bag+50, not bag+100. Python's gate therefore **refused a `get <magic-bag>` that ROM allows** (and do_put's fit check over-counted). The canonical `Character` carry-weight (`mud/models/character.py:_object_carry_weight`) already applied the multiplier; only these two duplicated command-gate helpers diverged. Fix: both helpers now apply `_get_weight_mult(obj)` (the existing WEIGHT_MULT helper) to the recursion. Surfaced 2026-07-04 by a container-mechanics probe in the autonomous loop (same probe as PUT-004). Tests: `tests/integration/test_get_weight_mult.py` (2 — both helpers scale contents by WEIGHT_MULT; `do_get` accepts a magic bag whose scaled weight fits `can_carry_w`). |
| `do_steal()` | 2161-2404 | ✅ `thief_skills.py::do_steal()` (line 99) | ✅ **AUDITED** | STEAL-001..014 fixed (full rewrite); 15/15 integration tests in `test_steal_command.py`. See do_steal section below. |

### 2. Object Placement Commands (P0 - CRITICAL)

| ROM C Function | Lines | QuickMUD | Status | Notes |
|----------------|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| `do_put()` | 346-494 | ✅ `obj_manipulation.py::do_put()` (line 52) | ✅ **AUDITED** | PUT-001..003 fixed (TO_ROOM messages, WEIGHT_MULT check, pit timer); 15/15 integration tests across `test_put_room_messages.py`, `test_put_weight_mult.py`, `test_put_pit_timer.py`. **PUT-004 ✅ FIXED (2.14.252):** putting an item into a **carried** container corrupted the carrier's `carry_weight`/`carry_number`. ROM `obj_from_char` subtracts the item's weight/number (`src/handler.c:1678-1679`); `obj_to_obj` then walks the container nesting chain and re-adds `get_obj_number(obj)` + `get_obj_weight(obj) * WEIGHT_MULT(container) / 100` for each *carried* container (`src/handler.c:1971-1984`), so a normal carried bag (WEIGHT_MULT=100) is net-zero and a magic bag reduces weight. The port's local `_obj_from_char` subtracted but `_obj_to_obj` re-added **nothing**, so `put sword bag` (carried bag) permanently dropped `carry_weight` by the sword's weight — a player could stuff a carried bag to slip under the `can_carry_w` movement/encumbrance gate. Fix: `_obj_to_obj` now performs the ROM carried-container re-add walk. Cross-ref **INV-011** (CARRY-WEIGHT-COHERENCE). Surfaced 2026-07-04 by a container-mechanics cold-path probe in the autonomous loop. Test: `tests/integration/test_put_weight_mult.py::test_put_into_carried_bag_is_net_zero_on_carry_weight`. **PUT-005 ✅ FIXED (2.14.298):** `put all <container>` with nothing eligible emitted a non-ROM "You have nothing to put." ROM `do_put`'s put-all branch (`src/act_obj.c:451-491`) is a bare `for` loop with **no `found` flag and no trailing message** — nothing eligible ⇒ ROM prints nothing. Same invented-message class as MOVE-006. Reachable via `put all bag` with only the bag carried (a container can't be put into itself). Fix: `count == 0` returns `""`. Surfaced 2026-07-10 by an object-manipulation hunter sweep, verified against ROM C. Test: `tests/integration/test_put005_empty_put_all_silent.py`. **PUT-006 ✅ FIXED (2.14.305):** the container token defaulted to the **last** word (`container_name = parts[-1]`), overridden to `parts[2]` only on `in`/`on`. ROM (`src/act_obj.c:354-362`) uses the **second** token (`arg2`), re-read to the third only if `arg2` is `in`/`on`, with an empty-`arg2` → "Put what in what?" guard. `put ring bag junk` targeted `junk` in Python but `bag` in ROM. Rewrote the parse to the faithful ROM `arg1`/`arg2` form. Test: `tests/integration/test_put_room_messages.py::test_put_006_container_is_second_token_not_last_word`. Surfaced 2026-07-10 by an object-manipulation hunter sweep, verified against ROM C. |
| `do_drop()` | 496-657 | ✅ `inventory.py::do_drop()` (line 171) | ✅ **AUDITED** | `drop all`, `drop all.type`, money consolidation, ITEM_MELT_DROP, no-drop, wear-state exclusion all verified; 15/15 integration tests in `test_drop_command.py`. **DROP-001** ✅ FIXED (2.14.299): the coin-drop branch gate used `arg.isdigit()` (`inventory.py:644`) where ROM uses `is_number(arg)` (`src/act_obj.c:511`). `is_number` accepts a leading `-`/`+`, so `drop -5 coins` enters the coin branch in ROM → `atoi("-5")=-5` → `amount <= 0` → **"Sorry, you can't do that."**, whereas Python's `"-5".isdigit()==False` fell through to the item path → **"You do not have that item."** Closed the **`is_number`/`atoi` parity class** with shared `rom_is_number`/`rom_atoi` helpers in `mud/math/c_compat.py` (mirror `src/interp.c:696` / C `atoi`); `do_drop` now gates on `rom_is_number` and reads `rom_atoi`. Sibling WIMPY-002 (ACT_INFO_C_AUDIT) reuses `rom_atoi`. Test: `tests/integration/test_drop_command.py::test_drop_negative_coin_amount_enters_coin_branch_like_rom_is_number`. Surfaced 2026-07-10 by a give/drop hunter sweep, verified against ROM C. |
| `do_give()` | 659-847 | ✅ `give.py::do_give()` (line 13) | ✅ **AUDITED** | Money paths (gold/silver/coin), equipped-item rejection, carry-limit, bribe trigger, changer NPC return-change, TO_NOTVICT exclusion all verified; 14/14 integration tests in `test_give_command.py`. **(Correction 2.14.150:** the changer gold-branch formula was NOT actually correct despite this ✅ — see GIVE-004 below; the gold branch had a spurious extra `/100`.) **INV-025 PERS reconciliation (2.12.54):** both branches baked the giver name via `act_format(recipient=None)`+`_broadcast_to_room_observers` (no PERS masking), and the **coins branch never dispatched TRIG_ACT** though ROM `:726` is NOT MOBtrigger-suppressed. Converted both to `act_to_room(exclude=victim)` — object branch wrapped in `disable_mobtrigger()` (ROM `:832` MOBtrigger=FALSE; `mp_give_trigger` still fires), coins branch plain so TRIG_ACT fires. Removed the now-unused `_broadcast_to_room_observers` helper. See CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER INV-025 (`tests/integration/test_inv025_give_pers_sweep.py`). **GIVE-006 ✅ FIXED (2.14.307) — resolved to STRICT PARITY:** giving a **worn** item emitted "You must remove it first." where ROM emits "You do not have that item." ROM `get_obj_carry` (`src/handler.c:2306`) matches only `wear_loc == WEAR_NONE`, so a worn item returns NULL at `do_give` (`src/act_obj.c:783`) → "You do not have that item." ROM's `if (obj->wear_loc != WEAR_NONE) "You must remove it first."` (`:785-788`) is **dead code** (obj is non-NULL only when unworn). The port's `_find_equipped_obj` fallback surfaced that dead-code message — arguably more helpful, but non-ROM. Per the AGENTS.md **ROM-FAITHFUL** rule (replicate ROM output exactly; a "more helpful" divergence is still a divergence), dropped the `_find_equipped_obj` fallback (and its now-dead helper); a worn item now returns "You do not have that item." **Revertible** if a UX exception is later desired. Test: `tests/integration/test_give_command.py::test_give_equipped_item_reports_not_carried_like_rom`. Surfaced 2026-07-10 by an object-manipulation hunter sweep, verified against ROM C. |

### 3. Equipment Commands (P0 - CRITICAL)

| ROM C Function | Lines | QuickMUD | Status | Notes |
|----------------|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| `do_wear()` | 1699-1738 | ✅ `equipment.py::do_wear()` (line 51) | ✅ **AUDITED** | WEAR-001..009 fixed; replace logic, two-handed/shield/hold interactions, multi-slot wrist/neck/finger, location-specific text, light handling, TO_ROOM messages, `wear all` routing all verified; 52 tests passing across `test_equipment_system.py` + `test_player_equipment.py`. **WEAR-010 ✅ FIXED (2.14.251):** `do_wear` resolved its target with a substring-only `_find_obj_inventory` helper instead of ROM's `get_obj_carry` (`src/act_obj.c:1726` `get_obj_carry(ch, arg, ch)`), so the `N.name` count prefix never parsed — `wear 2.ring` returned "You do not have that item." where ROM wears the 2nd of two same-named rings. `do_wield`/`do_hold` delegate to `do_wear` (ROM `interp.c`: `wield`/`hold`/`wear` all map to `do_wear`), so all three were affected. Fix: `do_wear` now calls `get_obj_carry(ch, args)` (already used by `do_get`/`do_quaff`/`do_eat`) — a strict superset of the old substring match; the now-dead equipment-local `_find_obj_inventory` was removed. Same EAT-008 finder class. Surfaced 2026-07-04 by a weak-finder sweep during the autonomous parity loop. Test: `tests/integration/test_equipment_system.py::test_wear_count_prefix_selects_nth_item`. |
| `do_remove()` | 1740-1763 | ✅ `obj_manipulation.py::do_remove()` (line 272) | ✅ **AUDITED** | 100% parity; `remove all` is documented Python extension. **FINDING-016 (2026-06-03):** generated diff-harness coverage found remove→rewear left stale `obj.worn_by`; fixed by clearing it in `_remove_obj`. |
| `wear_obj()` | 1401-1697 | ✅ `equipment.py::do_wear()`/`do_wield()`/`do_hold()` | ✅ **AUDITED** | Slot/replace/multi-slot logic verified via WEAR-001..009 (all closed) |
| `remove_obj()` | 1372-1392 | ✅ `obj_manipulation.py::_perform_remove()` (line 339) | ✅ **AUDITED** | NOREMOVE check + TO_CHAR/TO_ROOM "$n stops using $p" pair match ROM; FINDING-016 regression covers `wear_loc`, inventory, equipment, and `worn_by` cleanup after removal. |

### 4. Consumable Commands (P1 - IMPORTANT)

| ROM C Function | Lines | QuickMUD | Status | Notes |
|----------------|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| `do_quaff()` | 1865-1908 | ✅ `obj_manipulation.py::do_quaff()` (line 469) | ✅ **AUDITED** | QUAFF-001 fixed: TO_ROOM "$n quaffs $p." now broadcast before spell casting |
| `do_recite()` | 1910-1976 | ✅ `magic_items.py::do_recite()` | ✅ **AUDITED** | RECITE-001..005 fixed: full rewrite — was raising `NameError` (undefined `SkillTarget`/`SKILL_TARGET_MAP`) on success path. RECITE-001: ROM `get_obj_carry` lookup (instead of substring scan of `ch.inventory`). RECITE-002: TO_ROOM `$n recites $p.` via `act_format`/`broadcast_room` (was inline f-string). RECITE-003: spell dispatch delegates to `obj_manipulation._obj_cast_spell` (no longer references missing `skill_handlers` dict). RECITE-004: scroll consumed via `_extract_obj` (matches ROM 1972 `extract_obj` regardless of success). RECITE-005: target arg `arg2[0]=='\0'` defaults to `victim=ch`; otherwise tries `get_char_room` then `get_obj_here`. 5 integration tests passing. **INV-025 PERS reconciliation (2.12.52):** RECITE-002's `act_format(recipient=None)`+`broadcast_room` baked the actor name (an invisible reciter leaked it); converted to `act_to_room` for per-recipient PERS masking — see CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER INV-025 (`tests/integration/test_inv025_obj_command_pers_sweep.py`). **RECITE-006 ✅ FIXED (2.14.99):** category-error / borrowed-gate divergence — Python had an empty-arg gate `if not arg1: return "What do you want to recite?"` that ROM `do_recite` does **not** have (it was borrowed from the sibling `do_quaff`'s "Quaff what?", `src/act_obj.c:1872`). ROM goes straight to `get_obj_carry(ch, arg1, ch)` (`:1921`); with an empty arg, `is_name("")` returns FALSE (`src/handler.c:942-943`, the explicit "fixed to prevent is_name on \"\" returning TRUE" guard), so the lookup returns NULL → "You do not have that scroll." — even while holding a non-scroll. Removed the borrowed gate; Python's own `is_name`/`get_obj_carry` already short-circuit on empty input, so they match this fixed ROM source exactly (no `get_obj_carry` change needed — the prior-session "is_name('')==TRUE first-match" hypothesis was overturned by re-reading the C). Surfaced 2026-06-14 by the act_obj.c entry-gate / category-error sweep. Test: `tests/integration/test_consumables.py::test_recite_empty_arg_has_no_borrowed_what_gate`. |
| `do_drink()` | 1161-1282 | ✅ `consumption.py::do_drink()` (line 87) | ✅ **AUDITED** | DRINK-001..009 fixed: no-arg fountain scan, drunk pre-check, get_obj_here lookup, list-based condition updates, liq_table affect calculations, post-condition feedback, TO_ROOM act, ROM poison fields, immortal full-bypass; LIQUID_TABLE extended with affect arrays. **DRINK-010 ✅ FIXED (2.14.34):** the liquid-decrement was guarded on `item_type == DRINK_CON and value[0] > 0`, but ROM gates it on `value[0] > 0` **alone** (`src/act_obj.c:1276-1277`), regardless of item type — so a fountain with a positive capacity (`value[0] > 0`) drains its `value[1]` in ROM (going negative, since the FOUNTAIN branch has no empty-check) but stayed frozen in Python. Removed the spurious `item_type == DRINK_CON` clause. Surfaced 2026-06-13 by a post-EAT-006 do_drink/do_eat sibling re-read. Tests: `tests/integration/test_consumables.py::test_drink_from_fountain_with_capacity_decrements_value` (+ existing `::test_drink_from_fountain_does_not_decrement` re-pinned to the `value[0]==0` case). **DRINK-011 ✅ FIXED (2.14.152):** the four `gain_condition` deltas (`amount * liq_affect[X] / divisor`, ROM `src/act_obj.c:1243-1250`) used bare Python `//`, but the `liq_affect` columns CAN be negative (slime mold juice thirst=-8, blood=-1, salt water=-2) — and `//` floors toward -inf where ROM's C `/` truncates toward zero. Drinking slime mold juice (ssize=2, thirst=-8): delta `2 * -8 // 10 == -2` vs ROM `-16 / 10 == -1`, so the player got thirsty twice as fast as ROM for negative-affect liquids. DRINK-005's "liq_table affect calculations ✅" was a stale-✅ (the sign case was never exercised — all positive-affect liquids are bit-identical under `//` and `c_div`). Surfaced 2026-06-19 by an Explore-agent C-vs-Python probe of `do_drink`, verified against `src/const.c` liq_table negatives. Fix: all four deltas now use `c_div` per AGENTS.md signed-math. Test: `tests/integration/test_consumables.py::test_drink_negative_thirst_affect_truncates_toward_zero`. |
| `do_eat()` | 1284-1370 | ✅ `consumption.py::do_eat()` (line 18) | ✅ **AUDITED** | EAT-001..005 fixed: PILL type, immortal bypass, fullness pre-check, TO_ROOM broadcast, ROM poison affect fields. **EAT-006 ✅ FIXED (2.14.32):** the FOOD branch reimplemented the condition clamp inline as `min(48, current + value)` instead of calling `gain_condition` (as `do_drink` DRINK-004 does). That bypassed `gain_condition`'s `level >= LEVEL_IMMORTAL` early-return and its `condition == -1` permanent-satiation sentinel (ROM src/update.c:367-377) — so an immortal eating food had FULL/HUNGER wrongly bumped, and a -1 slot was clobbered to `min(48, -1+value)`. Now delegates to `gain_condition(ch, Condition.FULL/HUNGER, value[0]/value[1])`, mirroring ROM act_obj.c:1326-1327. Tests: `tests/integration/test_consumables.py::test_eat_food_does_not_change_immortal_conditions`, `::test_eat_food_respects_permanent_condition_sentinel`. **EAT-007 ✅ FIXED (2.14.35):** the poison branch derived the affect's level/duration from `value[0] if value[0] else 1` instead of ROM's raw `obj->value[0]` (`src/act_obj.c:1347-1348`: `af.level = number_fuzzy(value[0]); af.duration = 2*value[0]`). So poisoned food with `value[0]==0` got `duration=2` (2*1) and `level=number_fuzzy(1)` where ROM gives `duration=0` and `level=number_fuzzy(0)`. `number_fuzzy` is still called exactly once either way, so the shared RNG stream stays aligned — only the argument diverged. Now uses raw `value[0]`. Surfaced 2026-06-13 by a post-DRINK-010 do_eat full-body re-read. Test: `tests/integration/test_consumables.py::test_eat_poison_duration_uses_raw_value0_not_substituted_one`. **EAT-008 ✅ FIXED (2.14.250):** `do_eat` resolved its target with the substring-only `_find_obj_inventory` helper instead of ROM's `get_obj_carry` (`src/act_obj.c:1296` `get_obj_carry(ch, arg, ch)`), so the `N.name` count prefix never parsed — `eat 2.mushroom` returned "You do not have that item." where ROM eats the 2nd item (`get_obj_carry` runs `number_argument` + `is_name`, `src/handler.c`). The correct `get_obj_carry` (`mud/world/obj_find.py`, which parses `N.` and matches name+short_descr) was already used by `do_quaff`/`do_drink`/`do_give`; only `do_eat` was wired to the weaker finder. Fix: `do_eat` now calls `get_obj_carry(ch, args)` (a strict superset of the old substring match); the now-dead consumption-local `_find_obj_inventory` was removed. Surfaced 2026-07-04 by a `do_drink`/`do_eat`/`do_quaff` cold-path probe. Test: `tests/integration/test_consumables.py::test_eat_count_prefix_selects_nth_item`. |
| `do_fill()` | 965-1031 | ✅ `liquids.py::do_fill()` (line 13) | ✅ **AUDITED** | FILL-002: added TO_ROOM broadcast (`$n fills $p with %s from $P.`); FILL-003: TO_CHAR wording verified correct; FILL-004: skipped (get_obj_carry shape difference, non-functional) |
| `do_pour()` | 1033-1159 | ✅ `liquids.py::do_pour()` (line 93) | ✅ **AUDITED** | POUR-001: added TO_ROOM broadcast on `pour out`; POUR-002: added TO_ROOM on object-to-object pour; POUR-003: added TO_VICT and TO_NOTVICT on character-target pour; POUR-004 (critical bug): fixed hold-slot lookup from wrong string keys to `target_char.equipment[WearLocation.HOLD]`; POUR-005: no gap; POUR-006: skipped (article cosmetic) |

### 5. Shop Commands (P1 - IMPORTANT)

| ROM C Function | Lines | QuickMUD | Status | Notes |
|----------------|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| `do_buy()` | 2531-2771 | ✅ `shop.py::do_buy()` (line 650) | ✅ **AUDITED** | BUY-001..004 (keeper-voiced refusals + ch.reply) and BUY-005 (haggle on buy) fixed; minor cosmetic gaps deferred. **BUY-011 ✅ FIXED (2.14.254):** the multi-buy stock check (`_collect_matching_stock`) scanned the keeper's ENTIRE inventory and counted non-adjacent duplicates, but ROM `do_buy` (`src/act_obj.c:2667-2686`) counts only a **consecutive run** — it walks `obj->next_content` and `break`s at the first non-matching item. So with a keeper carrying `[lantern, dagger, lantern]`, `buy 2*lantern` in ROM refuses ("I don't have that many in stock.") because the two lanterns are not adjacent, but the port sold both. The interleaved layout is reachable in normal play because Python's `do_sell` head-inserts rather than grouping duplicates. Fix: `_collect_matching_stock` now `break`s on the first non-matching candidate after the selected object, mirroring ROM's consecutive-run count. Surfaced 2026-07-04 by a shop-pricing probe in the autonomous loop. Test: `tests/test_shops.py::test_buy_multi_stock_requires_consecutive_run`. **SELL-005 ✅ FIXED (2.14.255):** `_obj_to_keeper` (shop.py:102-106) guarded cost-standardization with `if existing_cost:`, so when the sold item stacked onto a `cost==0` existing same-proto duplicate it kept its own cost; ROM `obj_to_keeper` (`src/act_obj.c:2424`) assigns `obj->cost = t_obj->cost` **unconditionally** ("keep it standard"), zeroing the sold item's cost. Removed the guard. Surfaced 2026-07-04 as the BUY-011 probe's secondary finding. Test: `tests/test_shops.py::test_obj_to_keeper_standardizes_cost_even_when_existing_is_zero`. |
| `do_sell()` | 2871-2963 | ✅ `shop.py::do_sell()` (line 769) | ✅ **AUDITED** | SELL-001 / SELL-004 (keeper-voiced refusals) and SELL-006 (`obj_to_keeper` dedup against ITEM_INVENTORY copies) fixed |
| `do_list()` | 2773-2869 | ✅ `shop.py::do_list()` (line 590) | ✅ **AUDITED** | LIST-002 (pet-shop branch with kennel listing), LIST-003 (`wear_loc` filter to skip keeper's worn items), LIST-004 (`can_see_obj(ch, obj)` buyer filter) fixed |
| `do_value()` | 2965-3018 | ✅ `shop.py::do_value()` (line 1043) | ✅ **AUDITED** | VAL-004 (keeper-voiced price quote with `$p` item-name substitution) fixed. **VAL-005 ✅ FIXED (2.14.153):** the can't-see (`:2994`) and uninterested (`:3007`) branches hardcoded `"The shopkeeper doesn't see what you are offering."` / `"The shopkeeper looks uninterested in that."` instead of ROM's `act("$n …"/"$n looks uninterested in $p.", keeper, obj, ch, TO_VICT)` — so a named keeper showed "The shopkeeper" and the uninterested line dropped the item name entirely. The sibling `do_sell` already rendered these correctly via `_act_to_char` (SELL-002/003); `do_value` was the outlier. Surfaced 2026-06-19 by an Explore-agent C-vs-Python probe of the shop commands, verified against source. Fix: both branches now use `_act_to_char(keeper, "$n …", obj=…)`. Test: `tests/integration/test_shop_error_paths.py::test_value_uninterested_uses_keeper_name_and_item`. |

### 6. Special Action Commands (P1-P2)

| ROM C Function | Lines | QuickMUD | Status | Priority | Notes |
|----------------|-------|----------|--------|----------|-------|
| `do_sacrifice()` | 1765-1863 | ✅ `obj_manipulation.py::do_sacrifice()` (line 257) | ✅ **AUDITED** | P1 | SAC-001..005 fixed: TO_ROOM broadcasts, WearFlag.NO_SAC (1<<15), PlayerFlag.AUTOSPLIT (1<<7), UMIN unconditional; 6/6 tests passing. **SAC-006 ✅ FIXED (2.14.55):** the rejection line `f"{obj.short_descr} is not an acceptable sacrifice."` and the furniture line `f"{person.name} appears to be using {obj.short_descr}."` baked the names without ROM's act() buf[0] capitalization — ROM `act("$p is not an acceptable sacrifice.", ch, obj, 0, TO_CHAR)` / `act("$N appears to be using $p.", ch, obj, gch, TO_CHAR)` cap the first letter, so a lowercase short_descr ("a blessed relic") renders "A blessed relic …". Rendered both via `act_format` ($p/$N + cap; $N also adds PERS masking). Surfaced 2026-06-13 applying the CONSIDER-001 ACT-CAP / `$N` lens to act_obj. Test: `tests/integration/test_sacrifice_command.py::test_sacrifice006_rejection_capitalizes_object_name`. |
| `do_envenom()` | 849-963 | ✅ `skills/handlers.py::envenom()` (line 3625) + `remaining_rom.py::do_envenom()` shim | ✅ **AUDITED** | P1 | ENV-001 (WAIT_STATE on all 4 exit points) and ENV-002 (raw `attack_table[idx].damage == DAM_BASH` check; was misusing mapped enum which folds DAM_NONE→BASH and over-rejected) fixed; ENV-003 deferred (gsn_poison sn vs -1 affects only never-walked obj.affected); ENV-004: dispatcher shim cleaned up. 18/18 tests passing |
| `do_brandish()` | 1978-2066 | ✅ `magic_items.py::do_brandish()` | ✅ **AUDITED** | P2 | BRANDISH-001..006 fixed: was unrunnable (referenced `ItemType.ITEM_STAFF`, undefined `SkillTarget`/`SKILL_TARGET_MAP`, `equipment.get("held")` string-key lookup). BRANDISH-001: HOLD-slot lookup now uses `equipment[WearLocation.HOLD]` IntEnum key (POUR-004 pattern). BRANDISH-002: `ItemType.STAFF` (no `ITEM_` prefix) per `mud/models/constants.py:291`. BRANDISH-003: ROM 2004 `WAIT_STATE(ch, 2*PULSE_VIOLENCE)` applied unconditionally before charge gate (was inside fail path only). BRANDISH-004: TO_ROOM `$n brandishes $p.`/`...and nothing happens.`/`$n's $p blazes bright and is gone.` via `act_format`+`broadcast_room`. BRANDISH-005: target dispatch via skill `target` string ("ignore"/"victim"/"friendly"/"self") mapped to ROM TAR_IGNORE/TAR_CHAR_OFFENSIVE/TAR_CHAR_DEFENSIVE/TAR_CHAR_SELF (lines 2023-2048). BRANDISH-006: charge decrement is unconditional after if-block (ROM 2056 `--staff->value[2]`); destruction extract_obj fires when `<=0`. 4 integration tests passing. **INV-025 PERS reconciliation (2.12.52):** BRANDISH-004's `act_format(recipient=None)`+`broadcast_room` baked the actor name; the `_broadcast` helper now delegates to `act_to_room` for per-recipient PERS masking — see CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER INV-025 (`tests/integration/test_inv025_obj_command_pers_sweep.py`). **BRANDISH-007 ✅ FIXED (2.14.36):** `check_improve(ch, "staves", True, 2)` was hoisted to run once *after* the per-target loop; ROM (`src/act_obj.c:2050-2052`) calls it *inside* the loop, once per cast. For AoE staves (TAR_CHAR_OFFENSIVE/DEFENSIVE hitting N targets) the Python under-counted skill-learn rolls and under-drew the shared MM RNG (`check_improve` rolls `number_range(1,1000)` for PCs) by N−1. Moved inside the loop. Regression: `tests/integration/test_consumables.py::test_brandish_check_improve_fires_once_per_affected_target`. |
| `do_zap()` | 2068-2159 | ✅ `magic_items.py::do_zap()` | ✅ **AUDITED** | P2 | ZAP-001..006 fixed: same family of bugs as brandish (unrunnable success path, wrong HOLD lookup, `ItemType.ITEM_WAND`, undefined SkillTarget). ZAP-001: HOLD lookup now `equipment[WearLocation.HOLD]`. ZAP-002: `ItemType.WAND` per `mud/models/constants.py:290`. ZAP-003: `WAIT_STATE` applied after target resolution, before charge gate (ROM 2117). ZAP-004: act-trio messages — TO_NOTVICT (excludes ch+victim), TO_CHAR, TO_VICT — now use `act_format` with proper `$n`/`$N`/`$p` substitution; helper `_broadcast` extended to accept iterable exclusion since `broadcast_room` only takes a single character. ZAP-005: object-target branch broadcasts `$n zaps $P with $p.` TO_ROOM (ROM 2129). ZAP-006: charge decrement unconditional; on `<=0` broadcasts `$n's $p explodes into fragments.` and extracts the wand. 6 integration tests passing. **INV-025 PERS reconciliation (2.12.52):** ZAP-004's `act_format(recipient=None)`+`broadcast_room` baked the actor/victim names; the `_broadcast` helper now delegates to `act_to_room` (TO_NOTVICT = exclude actor + victim via `exclude=victim`) for per-recipient PERS masking — see CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER INV-025 (`tests/integration/test_inv025_obj_command_pers_sweep.py`). |

### 7. Helper Functions (P0 - CRITICAL)

| ROM C Function | Lines | QuickMUD | Status | Notes |
|----------------|-------|----------|--------|-------|
| `get_obj()` | 92-193 | ✅ Integrated into `do_get()` | ✅ **AUDITED** | All ROM behaviors verified inline in `mud/commands/inventory.py::do_get`: CAN_WEAR ITEM_TAKE check, `carry_number + get_obj_number` vs `can_carry_n`, weight check vs `can_carry_w`, `_can_loot()`, furniture occupancy (ROM 127-134), pit-timer/HAD_TIMER (ROM 137-150), AUTOSPLIT for ITEM_MONEY (ROM 156-185). |
| `can_loot()` | 61-89 | ✅ `ai/__init__.py::_can_loot()` (line 168) | ✅ **AUDITED** | Verified line-by-line vs ROM `act_obj.c:61-89`: immortal bypass, no-owner bypass, owner-not-found bypass, self-name bypass, PLR_CANLOOT bypass, `is_same_group` bypass. Group equality compared via `getattr(.., "group", None)` — equivalent to ROM `is_same_group`. |
| `obj_to_keeper()` | 2406-2529 | ✅ Integrated into `shop.py::_obj_to_keeper()` (line 53) | ✅ **AUDITED** | Verified vs ROM 2406-2444: ITEM_INVENTORY dedup destroys new obj; non-inventory dupe inherits cost from existing; `carry_number`/`carry_weight` updated; `in_room`/`in_obj` cleared. SELL-006 covers this path. |
| `find_keeper()` | Forward ref | ✅ `shop.py::_find_keeper()` | ✅ **AUDITED** | Locates ROM-flagged ACT_IS_NPC + shopkeeper in room; refusal messages and `ch.reply` handling verified. |
| `get_cost()` | Forward ref | ✅ `shop.py::_get_cost()` (line 487) | ✅ **AUDITED** | Verified profit_buy/profit_sell percent multipliers, ITEM_INVENTORY half-price discount on dupe sells, integer-division via `c_div`. BUY-005 buy-haggle gap closed in shop audit. |
| `get_obj_keeper()` | Forward ref | ✅ Integrated into `shop.py::do_buy()` | ✅ **AUDITED** | `number_argument()` parsing (`_parse_number_argument`, line 391) honors ROM `<n>.<name>` syntax; `can_see_obj(keeper, obj) && can_see_obj(ch, obj)` filter applied inside the candidate loop (BUY-007, was missing despite this note's prior claim); ITEM_INVENTORY infinite-stock branch (line 705). |

### 3.1 do_get() Verification (ROM C lines 195-344, QuickMUD inventory.py:142-168) ✅ COMPLETE

**ROM C Function Signature**: `void do_get(CHAR_DATA *ch, char *argument)` (150 lines)

**QuickMUD Function Signature**: `def do_get(char: Character, args: str) -> str` (27 lines)

**Estimated Parity**: ❌ **~15%** (Only basic get from room implemented)

---

### 3.2 do_put() Verification (ROM C lines 346-494, QuickMUD obj_manipulation.py:52-187) ✅ COMPLETE

**ROM C Function Signature**: `void do_put(CHAR_DATA *ch, char *argument)` (149 lines)

**QuickMUD Function Signature**: `def do_put(char: Character, args: str) -> str` (136 lines)

**Estimated Parity**: ✅ **~85%** (Most features present, minor gaps)

#### Quick Assessment

| ROM C Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------------|--------|-------|
| Argument parsing ("in", "on" keywords) | ✅ **PRESENT** | Lines 74-76 |
| "Put what in what?" check | ✅ **PRESENT** | Lines 64-69 |
| Validate container not "all" | ✅ **PRESENT** | Lines 79-80 |
| Find container with get_obj_here | ✅ **PRESENT** | Lines 83-85 |
| Container type validation | ✅ **PRESENT** | Lines 88-90 |
| Container closed check | ✅ **PRESENT** | Lines 93-96 |
| Single object put | ✅ **PRESENT** | Lines 99-131 |
| "put all" and "put all.type" | ✅ **PRESENT** | Lines 133-187 |
| Self-reference check (obj == container) | ✅ **PRESENT** | Lines 105-106 |
| can_drop_obj check | ✅ **PRESENT** | Lines 109-110, 159-160 |
| Weight validation (total + single) | ✅ **PRESENT** | Lines 113-119, 163-169 |
| CONT_PUT_ON flag messages | ✅ **PRESENT** | Lines 128-131, 178-181 |
| TO_CHAR messages | ✅ **PRESENT** | All put actions |
| TO_ROOM messages | ❌ **MISSING** | No act() TO_ROOM |
| WEIGHT_MULT check | ❌ **MISSING** | ROM C lines 411-416, 458 |
| Pit timer handling | ❌ **MISSING** | ROM C lines 426-433, 465-472 |

#### Gap Summary

**⚠️ IMPORTANT Gaps (P1)**:
1. **PUT-001**: Missing TO_ROOM act() messages (others don't see put actions)
2. **PUT-002**: Missing WEIGHT_MULT check (containers in containers)
3. **PUT-003**: Missing pit timer handling (ITEM_HAD_TIMER flag logic)

**Overall**: do_put() has excellent coverage (~85%). Missing features are P1 (important but not critical).

### 3.3 Summary: Remaining P0 Commands (Quick Assessment)

**Note**: Full line-by-line verification deferred to save time. Quick assessment based on code review:

#### do_drop() (ROM C lines 496-657, QuickMUD inventory.py:171-181)

**Estimated Parity**: ❌ **~20%** (Basic drop only, no "all" support, no gold split)

**Major Gaps**:
- ❌ No "drop all" or "drop all.type" support
- ❌ No gold auto-split (AUTOSPLIT for money)
- ❌ No TO_ROOM messages
- ❌ No pit timer handling
- ✅ Basic drop single object works

#### do_give() (ROM C lines 659-847, QuickMUD give.py:13-200)

**Estimated Parity**: ✅ **~100% verified for current audited paths** (final sweep closed)

**Verified Coverage**:
- ✅ Money handling verified for `gold`, `silver`, `coin`, and `coins`
- ✅ NPC reactions verified for bribe triggers and changer exchange behavior
- ✅ Carry-slot and carry-weight saturation verified
- ✅ Numeric money error wording verified against ROM
- ✅ `give all` confirmed intentionally unsupported in ROM; missing-item path is correct
- ✅ TO_NOTVICT observer-message parity fixed so room echoes exclude both giver and victim

**Remaining Gaps**:
- ❓ No confirmed `do_give()` parity gaps remain from the current audit; next focus is `do_wear()`
  (GIVE-003 closed 2026-06-14)

| Gap ID | Severity | ROM C | Python | Description | Status |
|--------|----------|-------|--------|-------------|--------|
| `GIVE-001` | IMPORTANT | src/act_obj.c:834 (object) + ~726 (coins) | mud/commands/give.py:93, 147 | `do_give`'s recipient TO_VICT line (`"$n gives you $p."` / `"$n gives you N coins."`) is emitted in ROM via `act(..., TO_VICT)`, which writes straight to the descriptor — immediate. Both Python branches (object + coins) delivered it via raw `victim.messages.append(...)`, the mailbox fallback a **connected** PC only drains on its next prompt → a connected recipient saw the gift line **late**. INV-001 SINGLE-DELIVERY / MAGIC-003 wrong-channel family (the ACT_COMM-003 shape). The giver's TO_CHAR line is already correct (returned by `do_give`, sent by the connection loop) — only the victim leg was wrong-channel. Fix: both legs now route through `push_message` (async send for connected PCs, mailbox fallback for disconnected/tests); `push_message` does not dispatch TRIG_ACT, so the object branch's `disable_mobtrigger()` contract (ROM `:832` MOBtrigger=FALSE) is unaffected. Surfaced 2026-06-02 while probing mob-trigger ordering (the give-trigger ordering itself is faithful — obj is in the victim's inventory before `mp_give_trigger`). Existing give tests use disconnected chars (mailbox fallback) so they stayed green; the new test uses connected PCs. Test: `tests/integration/test_give001_victim_delivery_channel.py`. | ✅ FIXED (2.12.68) |
| `GIVE-002` | MINOR | src/act_obj.c — `act("$N has $S hands full.", ch, NULL, victim, TO_CHAR)`, `act("$N can't carry that much weight.", …)`, `act("$N can't see it.", …)`, `act("$N tells you 'Sorry, you'll have to sell that.'", …)` | mud/commands/give.py:do_give | **The four giver-facing rejection lines baked the victim NAME + a "their"-for-sexless possessive instead of ROM's act() pronouns.** ROM renders `$N` = PERS name and `$S` = gendered possessive (his/her/its). The Python used local `_victim_name`/`_victim_possessive` helpers whose possessive returned **"their"** for `Sex.NONE` where ROM's `$S` is **"its"** — so giving an over-full item to a sexless mob showed "Receiver has their hands full." vs ROM "Receiver has its hands full." (and a male victim's "his"). **Fix (2.14.54):** rendered all four via `act_format("$N …"/"$N has $S …", recipient=char, actor=char, arg2=victim)` (correct PERS + `$S`=its/his/her, caps buf[0]); deleted the two dead helpers. Surfaced 2026-06-13 applying the EMOTE-005/TELL-008 `$E`/`$S` pronoun lens to act_obj. Inverted `test_give_command.py` hands-full assertion (sexless → "its") + added `test_give002_hands_full_uses_gendered_possessive` (male → "his"). | ✅ FIXED (2.14.54) |
| `GIVE-003` | MINOR | src/act_obj.c:682-698 | mud/commands/give.py:`_give_money` | **Money-path gate-ordering inversion.** ROM's numeric-give branch validates *amount + currency* first (`amount <= 0 || arg2 not in {coins,coin,gold,silver}` → "Sorry, you can't do that.", :683-689) and only **then** re-reads arg2 as the recipient and tests for a missing victim (:693-698 → "Give what to whom?"). The first failing gate selects the message. Python's `_give_money` collapsed both into a single `if amount <= 0 or len(parts) < 3:` that prioritized the **missing-victim** branch, so a malformed currency or non-positive amount with **no recipient** (`give 3 copper`, `give 0 gold`) wrongly returned "Give what to whom?" instead of ROM's "Sorry, you can't do that." Same gate-ordering class as SHOUT-005/TELL-009 (a precondition checked in the wrong order picks the wrong feedback line). Both pre-existing cases (`give 3 copper receiver` → Sorry; `give 3 gold` → Give-what-to-whom) stayed correct — only the bad-currency/bad-amount-AND-missing-victim combination diverged, which had no test. **Fix (2.14.98):** reordered `_give_money` to check amount/currency before the recipient, matching ROM. Surfaced 2026-06-14 sweeping act_obj.c entry gates for the act_comm.c "category-error" shape (per-command gate sequence vs ROM). Tests: `tests/integration/test_give_command.py::test_give003_invalid_currency_without_target_uses_sorry_not_missing_target` + `::test_give003_zero_amount_without_target_uses_sorry_not_missing_target`. | ✅ FIXED (2.14.98) |
| `GIVE-004` | IMPORTANT | src/act_obj.c:741 | mud/commands/give.py:`_handle_changer_exchange` (220) | **Changer gold-branch exchange formula had an extra `/100`.** ROM `change = silver ? 95 * amount / 100 / 100 : 95 * amount` — the **gold** branch is `95 * amount` with NO division (giving N gold returns `95 * N` *silver*, since 1 gold == 100 silver so the 5% fee already lands in silver units). Python computed `95 * amount // 100` for the gold branch, dividing by an extra 100: giving 10 gold returned **9** silver instead of **950**, and any gold gift ≤ 1 wrongly tripped the "I'm sorry, you did not give me enough to change." path. The silver branch (`// 100 // 100`) was correct. Surfaced 2026-06-19 by an Explore-agent C-vs-Python probe of `do_give`, then verified against `src/act_obj.c:741` — directly contradicting the Phase-1 row's "changer NPC return-change … verified" ✅ (stale-✅ class per AGENTS.md re-verify rule). **Fix (2.14.150):** gold branch now `95 * amount`. Test: `tests/integration/test_give_command.py::test_give_gold_to_changer_returns_silver_minus_fee`. | ✅ FIXED (2.14.150) |
| `GIVE-005` | MINOR | src/act_obj.c:801 | mud/commands/give.py:64-66 | **Give-to-shopkeeper refusal did not set `ch->reply`.** ROM's shop branch (`if (IS_NPC(victim) && victim->pIndexData->pShop != NULL)`) emits `act("$N tells you 'Sorry, you'll have to sell that.'", …)` **and** sets `ch->reply = victim` (`:801`), so the giver can `reply` to the keeper afterward. Python returned the refusal line without updating `char.reply`, leaving the giver's reply target stale — `reply` is a live mechanic here (`do_reply` reads `char.reply`; `shop.py` sets it on keeper interactions). Surfaced 2026-06-19 by the same `do_give` C-vs-Python probe as GIVE-004, verified against source. **Fix (2.14.151):** set `char.reply = victim` before returning the refusal. Test: `tests/integration/test_give_command.py::test_give_item_to_shopkeeper_sets_reply_target`. | ✅ FIXED (2.14.151) |

#### do_wear() (ROM C lines 1699-1738 + wear_obj helper 1401-1697, QuickMUD equipment.py:51+)

**Estimated Parity**: ⚠️ **~80%** (Initial parity batch verified; deeper edge-case audit still open)

**Verified Coverage**:
- ✅ Location-specific wear text now matches ROM for successful wear actions
- ✅ Light objects follow the ROM `light ... and hold it` path and equip to the light slot
- ✅ Successful wear/wield/hold actions now broadcast TO_ROOM observer messages
- ✅ `wear all` now routes through weapon/light wear logic instead of skipping those items

**Remaining Gaps**:
- ❓ Need verification for replace logic and `remove_obj()` interactions
- ❓ Need verification for multi-slot fallback wording (finger/neck/wrist)
- ❓ Need verification for two-handed weapon and shield interactions across all entry paths
- ❓ Need verification for stat/level restriction edge cases and failure-side room messaging

#### do_remove() (ROM C lines 1740-1763, QuickMUD obj_manipulation.py:190-256)

**Estimated Parity**: ✅ **~80%** (Looks good from quick review)

**Major Gaps**:
- ❓ Need full verification for cursed items
- ❓ Need verification for "remove all"

- ✅ do_wear() / do_wield() / do_hold() - 100% ROM C parity (all 8 WEAR-* gaps closed; 92/93 tests passing, 1 unrelated skip)
- ⚠️ do_remove() - ~80% parity estimate

**Overall act_obj.c P0 Estimated Parity**: **~70%**

**Recommendation**: Finish the last `do_give()` sweep, then move directly to `do_wear()` for the next detailed verification pass.

**ROM C Function Signature**: `void do_get(CHAR_DATA *ch, char *argument)` (150 lines)

**QuickMUD Function Signature**: `def do_get(char: Character, args: str) -> str` (27 lines)

**Estimated Parity**: ❌ **~15%** (Only basic get from room implemented)

5. ❌ **No container validation** - Missing ITEM_CONTAINER/CORPSE_NPC/CORPSE_PC checks
6. ❌ **No container closed check** - Missing CONT_CLOSED flag validation
7. ❌ **No ITEM_TAKE flag check** - Should prevent taking non-takeable objects
8. ❌ **No furniture occupancy check** - Should prevent taking objects someone is using
9. ❌ **No pit greed check** - Missing OBJ_VNUM_PIT immortal check
10. ❌ **No pit timer handling** - Missing ITEM_HAD_TIMER flag logic

#### Implementation Notes

**ROM C Argument Parsing**:
```c
argument = one_argument(argument, arg1);  // Get first word
argument = one_argument(argument, arg2);  // Get second word
if (!str_cmp(arg2, "from"))               // Skip "from" keyword
    argument = one_argument(argument, arg2);
```

**QuickMUD Current**:
```python
name = args.lower()  # Simple lowercase conversion, no parsing
```

**ROM C "all" Detection**:
```c
if (str_cmp(arg1, "all") && str_prefix("all.", arg1)) {
    // Single object
} else {
    // "all" or "all.type"
    for (obj = list; obj != NULL; obj = obj_next) {
        if ((arg1[3] == '\0' || is_name(&arg1[4], obj->name))
            && can_see_obj(ch, obj)) {
            // Process object
        }
    }
}
```

**ROM C AUTOSPLIT Logic** (lines 162-184):
```c
if (obj->item_type == ITEM_MONEY) {
    ch->silver += obj->value[0];
    ch->gold += obj->value[1];
    
    if (IS_SET(ch->act, PLR_AUTOSPLIT)) {
        members = 0;
        for (gch = ch->in_room->people; gch != NULL; gch = gch->next_in_room) {
            if (!IS_AFFECTED(gch, AFF_CHARM) && is_same_group(gch, ch))
                members++;
        }
        
        if (members > 1 && (obj->value[0] > 1 || obj->value[1])) {
            sprintf(buffer, "%d %d", obj->value[0], obj->value[1]);
            do_function(ch, &do_split, buffer);
        }
    }
    
    extract_obj(obj);
}
```

**ROM C Container Validation** (lines 270-289):
```c
switch (container->item_type) {
    default:
        send_to_char("That's not a container.\n\r", ch);
        return;
    
    case ITEM_CONTAINER:
    case ITEM_CORPSE_NPC:
        break;
    
    case ITEM_CORPSE_PC:
        if (!can_loot(ch, container)) {
            send_to_char("You can't do that.\n\r", ch);
            return;
        }
}
```

- `tests/integration/test_money_objects.py` - Added 6 integration tests (100% passing)

**Implementation Details**:

1. **AUTOSPLIT Logic** (ROM C act_obj.c:162-184):
   - ✅ Add silver/gold to character attributes (not inventory)
   - ✅ Check PLR_AUTOSPLIT flag
   - ✅ Count non-charmed group members in room
   - ✅ Auto-call `do_split()` if members > 1 and money > 1
   - ✅ Extract money object (consumed, not added to inventory)

2. **Bug Fixes**:
   - ✅ Fixed `is_same_group()` to use `getattr()` for defensive programming (handles MobInstance)
   - ✅ Fixed `do_split()` to exclude charmed members (ROM C lines 1906-1908)
   - ✅ Fixed `do_split()` distribution loop to exclude charmed members (ROM C lines 1930-1942)

3. **Integration Tests** (6/6 passing):

   - ✅ `test_autosplit_with_mixed_gold_and_silver` - Both currencies split correctly
   - ✅ `test_money_object_extracted_not_in_inventory` - Money object consumed (not in inventory)

**ROM C Parity Verification**:
- ✅ Money pickup adds to `char.silver` and `char.gold` attributes
- ✅ AUTOSPLIT flag checked correctly (PLR_AUTOSPLIT = 0x0080)
- ✅ Charmed members excluded from group count (AFF_CHARM = 0x00020000)
- ✅ `is_same_group()` matches ROM C logic (compare leaders)
- ✅ `do_split()` excludes charmed members from split distribution
- ✅ Money object extracted (not added to inventory)

**Test Results**:
```bash
pytest tests/integration/test_money_objects.py -v
# 19 passed, 2 skipped (100% AUTOSPLIT tests passing)
```

**Completion Criteria Met**:
- ✅ Import errors resolved
- ✅ Money pickup adds silver/gold to character
- ✅ AUTOSPLIT flag is checked
- ✅ Group members counted correctly (exclude charmed)
- ✅ do_split() called automatically when conditions met
- ✅ Money object extracted (not added to inventory)
- ✅ Integration tests passing (6/6 tests, 100%)
- ✅ No regressions in existing tests

### 5.4 GET-008: Furniture Occupancy Check - ✅ COMPLETE

**Completed**: January 9, 2026 - 03:00 CST

**ROM C Reference**: `src/act_obj.c` lines 126-134 (furniture occupancy check in get_obj helper)

**ROM C Code**:
```c
if (obj->in_room != NULL)
{
    for (gch = obj->in_room->people; gch != NULL; gch = gch->next_in_room)
        if (gch->on == obj)
        {
            act ("$N appears to be using $p.", ch, obj, gch, TO_CHAR);
            return;
        }
}
```

**Issue Discovered**: The furniture occupancy check existed in `mud/commands/inventory.py` (lines 233-243) but had a **CRITICAL BUG** - it checked `obj.in_room` instead of `obj.location`, causing the check to always fail silently.

**Implementation Summary**:

1. **Bug Fix**:
   - **OLD**: `obj_in_room = getattr(obj, "in_room", None)` ❌
   - **NEW**: `obj_location = getattr(obj, "location", None)` ✅
   - **Root Cause**: QuickMUD Object model uses `obj.location` for room, not `obj.in_room`
   - **Impact**: Before fix, players could take furniture others were sitting/standing on
   - **Fix Location**: `mud/commands/inventory.py` line 234

2. **ROM C Parity Verification**:
   - ✅ Check if object is in room (ROM C line 126: `if (obj->in_room != NULL)`)
   - ✅ Loop through room people (ROM C line 128: `for (gch = obj->in_room->people; ...)`)
   - ✅ Check if person is ON the object (ROM C line 129: `if (gch->on == obj)`)
   - ✅ Return error message (ROM C line 131: `act ("$N appears to be using $p.", ...)`)
   - ✅ Message format: "{name} appears to be using {object}."

3. **Integration Tests** (6/6 passing - 100%):
   - ✅ `test_get_furniture_with_someone_sitting_on_it` - SITTING position blocks taking
   - ✅ `test_get_furniture_with_someone_standing_on_it` - STANDING position blocks taking
   - ✅ `test_get_furniture_with_no_one_on_it` - Can take when empty
   - ✅ `test_get_furniture_with_someone_nearby_but_not_on_it` - Nearby person doesn't block
   - ✅ `test_get_furniture_multiple_people_on_it` - Multiple people blocks taking
   - ✅ `test_get_non_furniture_with_someone_on_it` - Check applies to ANY object type

**ROM C Behavioral Parity**: ✅ **100% VERIFIED**

**Test Results**:
```bash
pytest tests/integration/test_furniture_occupancy.py -xvs
# 6/6 passing (100%)

pytest tests/integration/test_room_retrieval.py tests/integration/test_container_retrieval.py tests/integration/test_money_objects.py -v
# 42/42 passing (no regressions)
```

**Completion Criteria Met**:
- ✅ Cannot take object if someone is sitting on it (Position.SITTING)
- ✅ Cannot take object if someone is standing on it (Position.STANDING)
- ✅ CAN take object if no one is on it
- ✅ Nearby people don't block taking (only `on=obj` blocks)
- ✅ Error message matches ROM C format
- ✅ Integration tests passing (6/6, 100%)
- ✅ No regressions in GET-001, GET-002, GET-003 tests

**Implementation Notes**:
- Bug was subtle - code structure looked correct but used wrong field name
- `obj.location` is the correct field in QuickMUD Object model (not `obj.in_room`)
- ROM C's `obj->in_room` maps to Python's `obj.location` in this codebase
- Check applies to ALL object types, not just ITEM_FURNITURE
- Position type doesn't matter - any character with `on=obj` prevents taking

**Files Modified**:
- `mud/commands/inventory.py` - Fixed line 234 (`obj.in_room` → `obj.location`)
- `tests/integration/test_furniture_occupancy.py` - Added 6 integration tests (NEW FILE)

### 5.8 PUT-001: TO_ROOM act() Messages - ✅ COMPLETE

**Completed**: January 9, 2026 - 02:14 CST

**ROM C Reference**: `src/act_obj.c` lines 440-441, 445-446, 479-480, 484-485

**Feature**: Observers in room see "puts" actions via TO_ROOM act() messages

**Implementation Summary**:

1. **Core Features Implemented**:
   - ✅ TO_ROOM messages for single object put (lines 440-441, 445-446)
   - ✅ TO_ROOM messages for "put all" loop (lines 479-480, 484-485)
   - ✅ "in" vs "on" message selection (CONT_PUT_ON flag check)
   - ✅ act_format() wrapper for ROM C act() compatibility

2. **Integration Tests** (5/5 passing - 100%):
   - ✅ `test_put_single_object_broadcasts_to_room` - Observer sees "puts" message
   - ✅ `test_put_excludes_actor_from_broadcast` - Actor excluded from TO_ROOM

### 5.9 PUT-002: WEIGHT_MULT Check - ✅ COMPLETE

**Completed**: January 9, 2026 - 02:14 CST

**ROM C Reference**: `src/act_obj.c` lines 411-416, 458

**Feature**: Prevent containers from being put into other containers (WEIGHT_MULT != 100)

**Implementation Summary**:

1. **Core Features Implemented**:
   - ✅ WEIGHT_MULT check for single object put (lines 411-416)
   - ✅ WEIGHT_MULT check in "put all" loop (line 458)
   - ✅ Error message: "That won't fit in there."
   - ✅ Containers with WEIGHT_MULT = 100 (normal bags) ARE allowed

2. **Integration Tests** (4/4 passing - 100%):
   - ✅ `test_cannot_put_container_in_container` - Magic bag (WEIGHT_MULT 10) blocked
   - ✅ `test_can_put_normal_object_with_weight_mult_100` - Normal items allowed
   - ✅ `test_put_all_skips_containers` - "put all" skips magic bags
   - ✅ `test_weight_mult_100_is_allowed` - Normal bags (WEIGHT_MULT 100) allowed

**ROM C Parity Verification**:
- ✅ ROM C line 411: `if (WEIGHT_MULT(obj) != 100)`
- ✅ ROM C line 412: `send_to_char("That won't fit in there.\n\r", ch);`
- ✅ WEIGHT_MULT formula: `container.value[4]` (default 100)
- ✅ Normal objects (non-containers) have WEIGHT_MULT = 100

**Test File**: `tests/integration/test_put_weight_mult.py`

**Bug Fix**:
- ✅ Fixed `_obj_from_char()` to use `char.inventory` instead of `char.carrying`
- This bug caused objects to remain in inventory after transfer
- All PUT tests now passing with correct inventory removal

### 5.10 PUT-003: Pit Timer Handling - ✅ COMPLETE

**Completed**: January 9, 2026 - 02:14 CST

**ROM C Reference**: `src/act_obj.c` lines 426-433, 465-472

**Feature**: Objects put into donation pit get timers (100-200 ticks) unless ITEM_HAD_TIMER flag set

   - ✅ Timer assignment for objects without timer (100-200 ticks)
   - ✅ ITEM_HAD_TIMER flag preservation (existing timers preserved)
   - ✅ Applies to both single put and "put all"
   - ✅ Normal containers don't trigger timer logic

## do_wear() / do_wield() / do_hold() Audit (2026-04-25)

ROM C reference: `src/act_obj.c:1401-1736` (`wear_obj`, `do_wear`).
Python target: `mud/commands/equipment.py`.

### CRITICAL gaps

| ID | ROM line | Python line | Gap | Status |
|----|----------|-------------|-----|--------|
| WEAR-001 | 1410-1411 | equipment.py:37-45, 149, 307, 438 | Level-fail path is missing the TO_ROOM `act("$n tries to use $p, but is too inexperienced.", ..., TO_ROOM)` broadcast. **Fixed** — `_broadcast_level_fail()` emits the TO_ROOM message and is called from `do_wear`, `do_wield`, and `do_hold`. Covered by `test_item_level_restriction`. | closed |
| WEAR-002 | 1415-1423, 1670-1677 | equipment.py:199-213, 478-494 | LIGHT/HOLD wording divergence; missing TO_ROOM `"$n holds $p in $s hand."` / `"$n lights $p and holds it."`. **Fixed** — `do_wear` (HOLD branch) and `do_hold` both branch on `ITEM_LIGHT` and emit ROM-faithful TO_CHAR + TO_ROOM messages. Covered by `test_wear_light_sets_light_slot`. | closed |
| WEAR-003 | 1623-1629 | equipment.py:24-34, 339 | WIELD weight check uses raw `STR * 10` instead of ROM's `str_app[STR].wield * 10` lookup. **Fixed** — `_STR_WIELD` table mirrors `src/const.c:728` `str_app[26]` wield column exactly; `_str_wield_max()` is consulted in `do_wield`. | closed |
| WEAR-004 | 1639 | equipment.py:377 | `do_wield` does not broadcast `"$n wields $p."` to the room. **Fixed** — `broadcast_room` emits `"{ch_name} wields {obj_name}."` after equip. **INV-025 PERS reconciliation (2.12.53):** the baked `f"{ch_name} wields {obj_name}."` leaked an invisible wielder's name; converted to `act_to_room(room, "$n wields $p.", ch, arg1=obj, exclude=ch)` for per-recipient PERS masking. Same sweep also converted the level-fail (`:1410`), remove (`:1389`), light (`:1419`), hold (`:1674` — was literal "their hand", now ROM's `$s hand` gendered possessive), and wear-by-slot (`:1435-1612`) baked lines. See CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER INV-025 (`tests/integration/test_inv025_equipment_pers_sweep.py`). | closed |

### IMPORTANT gaps

| ID | ROM line | Python line | Gap | Status |
|----|----------|-------------|-----|--------|
| WEAR-005 | 1643-1665 | equipment.py:380-407 | WIELD does not emit the seven-tier weapon-skill flavor message. **Fixed** — `_weapon_skill_flavor()` reproduces ROM's seven tiers and skips on `HAND_TO_HAND_SKILL`. | closed |
| ~~WEAR-006~~ | 1429-1431, 1458-1460, 1567-1569 | equipment.py:587-612 | ~~Multi-slot replace only attempts removal on the first occupied slot.~~ **VERIFIED NOT A BUG** on re-read: ROM's `&&` short-circuit means R removal only runs when L removal returned FALSE (locked). Python's "try L; on failure try R" matches that exactly. | closed |
| WEAR-007 | 1719 | equipment.py:514-516 | `wear all` iterates inventory without `can_see_obj(ch, obj)` filtering. **Fixed** — `_wear_all` calls `can_see_object(ch, obj)` and skips invisible items. | closed |
| WEAR-008 | 1382-1386 | equipment.py:61-66, 229-232 | NOREMOVE failure path emits `"You can't remove $p."` twice. **Fixed** — `_unequip_to_inventory` sends the NOREMOVE message once and the caller returns `""` on failure to avoid duplicate output. Covered by `test_wear_replace_blocked_by_noremove`. | closed |
| WEAR-009 | 1599-1608 | equipment.py:134-147 | SHIELD branch checks two-hand weapon BEFORE the slot remove attempt. ROM removes shield first, then checks; on failure the old shield is gone and the new one isn't equipped. **Fixed** — Python now mirrors ROM order per PARITY-not-IMPROVEMENT directive (player loses shield on rejected swap, matching ROM). | closed |
| WEAR-010 | 1401-1697 (`wear_obj` dispatcher) | equipment.py:158-163 | ROM `do_wear` calls `wear_obj` which dispatches to the WIELD branch (STR check, two-hand/shield check, weapon-skill flavor) when the item has `CAN_WEAR(ITEM_WIELD)`. Python `do_wear` instead returned "You need to wield weapons, not wear them." **Fixed** — extracted `_dispatch_wield(ch, obj)` from `do_wield`; `do_wear` now routes weapons through it, mirroring ROM's single-dispatcher design. Covered by `test_wear_010_do_wear_dispatches_weapon_to_wield`. | ✅ FIXED |
| WEAR-011 | 1670-1677 (`wear_obj` HOLD branch) | equipment.py:451-460 | ROM `do_hold` (= `do_wear`) HOLD branch calls `remove_obj(ch, WEAR_HOLD, fReplace=TRUE)` which auto-unequips the existing held item. Python `do_hold` previously rejected with `"You're already holding {name}."` **Fixed** — `do_hold` now calls `_unequip_to_inventory(existing)` to mirror ROM's auto-replace, identical to what `do_wear`'s HOLD branch already did. Covered by `test_wear_011_do_hold_auto_replaces_existing_held`. | ✅ FIXED |
| WEAR-012 | 1712-1723 (`do_wear` "all" loop) | equipment.py:452-514 (`_wear_all`) | ROM `wear all` loops carried `wear_loc == WEAR_NONE` items and calls `wear_obj(ch, obj, FALSE)` unconditionally — so it lights+holds ITEM_LIGHT, wields weapons, and holds HOLD-flag items. Python's `_wear_all` is a parallel reimplementation that `continue`s past weapons (line 479), HOLD items (481), and lights (`_get_wear_location → None`, 486), so `wear all` silently fails to equip them. Surfaced by the diff harness as **FINDING-034** (`test_generated_wear_all_matches_live_c`, currently `xfail(strict=True)`). **Fixed** — extracted a shared `_wear_obj(ch, obj, fReplace)` (equipment.py) mirroring ROM `wear_obj`; `do_wear <item>` calls it with `fReplace=True` (force-replace, behavior-preserving) and `_wear_all` with `fReplace=False` (occupied slots skipped silently per ROM `remove_obj`). `_wear_all` is now a thin loop over the shared dispatch — lights light+hold, weapons wield, HOLD items hold, exactly as the single-item path. Covered by `test_wear_all_equips_light_weapon_and_hold` + the diff-harness `test_generated_wear_all_matches_live_c` (xfail removed; converges vs live C oracle). FINDING-034 RESOLVED. | ✅ FIXED |
| WEAR-013 | 1635 (`wear_obj` WIELD branch) | equipment.py:438 | ROM's two-hands-free block for wielding a `WEAPON_TWO_HANDS` weapon while a shield is worn ends with a **period**: `"You need two hands free for that weapon."` (`src/act_obj.c:1635`). Python ended it with `"!"`. Note the sibling shield-branch message `"Your hands are tied up with your weapon!"` (`:1606`) correctly keeps its exclamation — only the WIELD-branch punctuation diverged. Found by a source-read sweep of `wear_obj`'s message strings. **Fixed (2.14.286)** — restored the period. Test: `tests/integration/test_equipment_system.py::test_shield_worn_blocks_two_handed_wield_exact_message`. | ✅ FIXED |
| WEAR-014 | 1765-1777 (`equip_char` alignment zap, src/handler.c) | equipment.py:112-176 (`_can_wear_alignment` + all 4 wear/wield/hold/light sites) | ROM's alignment zap lives in `equip_char`: when an evil PC dons an ITEM_ANTI_EVIL object (or good+ANTI_GOOD / neutral+ANTI_NEUTRAL) it emits `act("You are zapped by $p and drop it.", TO_CHAR)` + `act("$n is zapped by $p and drops it.", TO_ROOM)` then `obj_from_char(obj); obj_to_room(obj, ch->in_room)` — the item is **dropped to the floor**, with `$p` = the object short_descr. Python returned a generic `"You are zapped by the item and drop it."` (literal "the item", no `$p`), emitted **no** TO_ROOM broadcast, and **left the item carried** (a state divergence: the item stayed in inventory instead of lying on the ground). **Fixed (2.14.287)** — added `_zap_align(ch, obj)` (drops via `_obj_from_char` + `room.add_object`, room message, `$p` short_descr wording) and routed all four zap sites through it. **Residual (minor, documented):** ROM prints the "You wear $p ..." line before the zap (the zap is in equip_char, called after the wear message); Python checks alignment up-front and emits only the zap line — cosmetic ordering, observable *state* now matches. Test: `tests/test_player_equipment.py::TestAlignmentRestrictionsAndCursedItems::test_alignment_zap_drops_item_to_room_with_object_name`. | ✅ FIXED |
| WEAR-015 | 1401-1677 (`wear_obj` flag dispatch order) | equipment.py:262 (`_wear_obj` HOLD branch) | ROM `wear_obj` checks wear flags in **bit order**, so every armor/shield slot (WEAR_FINGER..WEAR_WRIST + WEAR_SHIELD — all bits below HOLD's 1<<14) is dispatched BEFORE the HOLD branch (HOLD is at `:1670`, second-to-last, just before FLOAT). An object flagged both an armor slot and HOLD is therefore worn on the armor slot, not held. Python's `_wear_obj` checked the HOLD flag first, so such an item was wrongly held. **Unreachable in stock data** (no stock object combines the flags — verified by scanning the area JSON) but the engine loads arbitrary custom areas, so the dispatch order must match ROM. Found by hunter-agent sweep of `wear_obj`'s dispatch order. **Fixed (2.14.288)** — added `_PRE_HOLD_WEAR_MASK` and guarded the HOLD branch with `and not (wear_flags & _PRE_HOLD_WEAR_MASK)`, so an item with an armor flag falls through to `_get_wear_location`. (WIELD, bit 13, is item_type-dispatched separately and excluded from the mask — the WEAPON-type vs ITEM_WIELD-flag dispatch difference is a separate latent edge, noted but not stock-reachable.) Test: `tests/test_player_equipment.py::test_hold_flag_yields_to_armor_slot_per_rom_flag_order`. | ✅ FIXED |

### Methodology

Per-slice audit dispatched to four parallel Haiku agents (one each for LIGHT/finger/neck, single-slot armor, wrist/shield/wield, hold/float/do_remove). Findings consolidated and re-verified against ROM source. The WIELD strength formula divergence was verified against `src/const.c:728` `str_app[26]` table (wield column: 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,22,25,30,35,40,45,50,55,60).

`do_remove` was inspected and matches ROM (empty arg → `"Remove what?"`, `all` support, lookup by worn slot). 2026-06-03 re-check: Phase C generated diff-harness coverage found a Python-only stale `obj.worn_by` back-pointer after `remove`; fixed as FINDING-016 and covered by `test_do_remove_happy_path_emits_both_messages`.

## do_steal() Audit (2026-04-27) - ✅ AUDITED

ROM C reference: `src/act_obj.c` lines 2161-2330. QuickMUD implementation:
`mud/commands/thief_skills.py::do_steal()` (full rewrite to close 14 gaps).

### Gaps fixed

| ID | ROM Line(s) | Gap | Resolution |
|----|-------------|-----|------------|
| STEAL-001 | 2174-2178 | Missing-arg path returned a string without `\n` and split on first space only (couldn't reject `"steal coins"` with one arg). | Use ROM `one_argument` parsing semantics: extract `arg1`, `arg2` and reject when either is empty with `"Steal what from whom?\n"`. |
| STEAL-002 | 2185-2189 | `victim is char` check came after `get_char_room`, but the QuickMUD helper excludes self, so self-name lookup returned `None` ("They aren't here") instead of "That's pointless". | Self-match by name (or `"self"`) before calling `get_char_room`. |
| STEAL-003 | 2191-2192 | `is_safe(ch, victim)` short-circuit was returning a fabricated message instead of letting `is_safe` send its own and exiting silently. | Call `is_safe`, return empty TO_CHAR (ROM behaviour: `is_safe` already messaged). **INV-050 completion (2.14.112):** the original fix returned `""` on the assumption "is_safe already messaged" — but it routed through the **silent bool** `combat.safety.is_safe`, which writes NO message, so a blocked steal showed *nothing* (and inherited the bool's PC-clan-ladder under-block). Converged `do_steal` onto the faithful mirror `combat._kill_safety_message` (do_bash/consider/cast/assist pattern): a non-None return is surfaced to ch (e.g. "I don't think Mota would approve."). Two PC-to-PC steal tests (`test_steal_failure_pc_to_pc_sets_thief_flag`, `test_steal_level_diff_forces_failure_pc_to_pc`) + two act-trigger tests asserted the silent-bool under-block (non-clan PC reaching PC-victim steal logic, which ROM is_safe blocks) and were ROM-corrected to clan thief/victim. Test: `tests/integration/test_steal_command.py::test_steal_from_safe_healer_surfaces_is_safe_line`. |
| STEAL-004 | 2213 | Missing ROM `is_clan(ch)` check — non-clan PCs could steal successfully. | Added `_is_clan(char)` (delegates to `mud.characters.is_clan_member`); included in failure-condition disjunction per ROM. |
| STEAL-005 | 2207, 2274-2275 | Used `//` integer division and `MAX_LEVEL = 51` (wrong constant) for coin scaling. | Use `c_div` and `MAX_LEVEL` from `mud.models.constants` (= 60). |
| STEAL-006 | 2291 | Coin success message order was `"{gold} gold and {silver} silver"`, ROM prints silver first: `"%d silver and %d gold coins."` | Reordered to `"{silver} silver and {gold} gold coins."`. |
| STEAL-007 | 2222-2223 | Failure path emitted no act() broadcasts — neither TO_VICT `"$n tried to steal from you."` nor TO_NOTVICT `"$n tried to steal from $N."`. | Direct delivery to `victim.messages` and to non-vict observers in `room.people`, mirroring ROM's TO_VICT/TO_NOTVICT split. |
| STEAL-008 | 2241-2245 | Sleeping victim was never woken before yelling, and the random yell text was built but never broadcast to the room. | Wake (set `position = STANDING`) then deliver yell text to all room occupants; sex-aware possessive (`her`/`his`) preserved. |
| STEAL-009 | 2256-2261 | PC→PC failure never set `PLR_THIEF` on the attacker. | Set `char.act |= PlayerFlag.THIEF` (using enum, not hardcoded hex) and append the "*** You are now a THIEF!! ***" message. |
| STEAL-010 | 2247-2250 | NPC failure called `multi_hit(victim, char, -1)`; the `-1` damage type was bogus. | Pass `None` (matches QuickMUD `multi_hit` `dt` default and ROM `TYPE_UNDEFINED`). |
| STEAL-011 | 2304-2306 | Item-rejection check used `wear_loc != -1` ("equipped"), missing the three real ROM rejections (`!can_drop_obj`, `ITEM_INVENTORY`, `obj->level > ch->level`) and the message was wrong. | Replaced with extra-flag NODROP / INVENTORY / level-gate using `ExtraFlag` enum; returns `"You can't pry it away.\n"`. Falls back to prototype `level` when instance level is 0. |
| STEAL-012 | 2308-2319 | Carry-limit checks used ad-hoc `_get_max_carry_*` helpers instead of canonical `can_carry_n`/`can_carry_w`, and used a single-slot count instead of `_object_carry_number`. | Use `mud.world.movement.can_carry_n/can_carry_w` and `_object_carry_number`/`_object_carry_weight` from `mud.models.character` (matches ROM `get_obj_number`/`get_obj_weight`). |
| STEAL-013 | 2322-2326 | Inventory transfer manipulated deprecated `victim.carrying` / `char.carrying` lists directly, leaving carry counters/weight stale (same bug class as PUT-001). | Use `victim.remove_object(obj)` + `char.add_object(obj)` so `carry_number`/`carry_weight` recalculate correctly. Output is `"You pocket $p.\n" + "Got it!\n"`. |
| STEAL-014 | 2300-2303 | `get_obj_carry(victim, name)` lacked the ROM third-arg `ch` visibility filter; invisible items in the victim's inventory were stealable. | Added local `_get_obj_carry_visible(victim, name, observer)` that gates each candidate through `can_see_object(observer, obj)` while preserving N.name syntax. |
| STEAL-015 ✅ FIXED | 2191-2192 | **The *skill-handler* `mud/skills/handlers.py:steal` (~7762) has NO is_safe check at all** ("safety check (simplified - no is_safe implemented yet)"). It is registered as the "steal" skill function (`data/skills.json:1816` `"function": "steal"`), so it is reachable via the skill system independently of the `do_steal` command (which IS gated, STEAL-003). A steal invoked through the skill path can target shopkeepers/healers/pets/safe-room mobs and bypass the PC clan ladder. Surfaced 2026-06-14 while converging `do_steal` for INV-050. | **FIXED** (2026-06-19, v2.14.129) — `handlers.steal` now gates on `combat._kill_safety_message` (the faithful is_safe mirror, `src/fight.c:1018-1124`) right after the `victim is caster` check and before the kill-stealing check, exactly mirroring ROM `do_steal` L2191→L2194 order. A non-None return ends the steal with the is_safe context line in the result dict's `message`. The block-set in `tests/test_skill_steal_rom_parity.py` was re-setup faithfully (NPC-victim tests given rooms; PC-vs-PC tests made clansmen within the PK ladder so is_safe passes through to each test's named ROM mechanic). Test: `tests/test_skill_steal_rom_parity.py::test_steal_from_safe_healer_blocked_via_skill_handler`. |

### Verification

- `pytest tests/ -k "steal or thief" -q` → 44 passed
- New integration coverage at `tests/integration/test_steal_command.py` (15 tests):
  missing-arg, self-target, fighting NPC, coin success message order, no-coins,
  item success transfer, ITEM_INVENTORY rejection, ITEM_NODROP rejection,
  obj-level > char-level rejection, no-clan PC failure, TO_VICT + TO_NOTVICT
  broadcast on failure, AFF_SNEAK strip, PC→PC sets PLR_THIEF, WAIT_STATE
  applied, PvP level-diff > 7 forces failure.
- The pre-existing skill-handler `mud/skills/handlers.py::steal()` is left
  untouched — it is exercised independently by `test_skill_steal_rom_parity.py`
  and is not in the `do_steal` command path.

## Final Audit Refresh (2026-04-27) — ✅ act_obj.c at 100% Parity

A formal refresh on 2026-04-27 re-verified every audited function in `src/act_obj.c`
against current Python implementations after the act_obj batch commit 517542b
("close get/put/drop/give/wear/sacrifice/recite/brandish/zap/steal gaps") and
the do_drop parity batch (97c901e). **Zero remaining gaps were found.**

### Verification evidence (2026-04-27)

- `pytest tests/integration/ -k "drop or remove or sacrifice or drink or eat or quaff or fill or pour or recite or brandish or zap"` → 193 passed, 2 skipped (unrelated).
- TO_ROOM broadcasts confirmed in `mud/commands/inventory.py:637-690` (do_drop coin + obj + MELT_DROP smoke).
- No `random.*` drift in `mud/commands/consumption.py`, `mud/commands/magic_items.py`, or `mud/commands/liquids.py` — all RNG goes through `mud.math.rng_mm`.
- IntEnum flag usage (PlayerFlag, WearFlag, ItemType, ExtraFlag, WearLocation) verified — no hardcoded hex.
- ROM C source cited in code comments throughout (e.g. `inventory.py:295` references `act_obj.c:151`).

### Outstanding ROM C functions (not in scope)

Helper functions and minor commands that ROM C exposes in `act_obj.c` but are
already covered by other Python modules or are not part of the player command
surface (e.g. `get_obj`, `find_obj`, `wear_obj` helper) are inventoried in
Phase 2 above and remain ✅ MAPPED. Nothing in `act_obj.c` is currently
unaudited or unimplemented.

### Tracker action taken

`docs/parity/ROM_C_SUBSYSTEM_AUDIT_TRACKER.md` row for `act_obj.c` flipped
from 🔄 IN PROGRESS / ~60% to ✅ COMPLETE / 100% as part of this refresh.

## Post-Audit Gap Discovery (2026-06-08)

Three divergences found while probing shop error-exit paths via diff-harness planning.

| Gap ID | Function | ROM C Lines | Description | Status |
|--------|----------|-------------|-------------|--------|
| **BUY-006** | `do_buy()` | 2688 vs 2702 | Check ordering: Python runs level check (ROM line 2702) before afford check (ROM line 2688); ROM C runs afford first | ✅ **FIXED** — `shop.py` reordered; `test_buy_afford_checked_before_level` |
| **SELL-002** | `do_sell()` | 2905-2908 | `!can_see_obj(keeper, obj)` branch emits hardcoded `"The shopkeeper doesn't see what you are offering."` — ROM C uses `act("$n doesn't see what you are offering.", keeper, NULL, ch, TO_VICT)` which expands `$n` to the keeper's name | ✅ **FIXED** — `_act_to_char` helper; `test_sell_cant_see_uses_keeper_name` |
| **SELL-003** | `do_sell()` | 2911-2914 | `get_cost <= 0` branch emits `"The shopkeeper doesn't buy that."` — ROM C uses `act("$n looks uninterested in $p.", keeper, obj, ch, TO_VICT)` (keeper name + item name) | ✅ **FIXED** — `_act_to_char` helper; `test_sell_uninterested_uses_keeper_name` |
| **BUY-007** | `do_buy()` / `get_obj_keeper()` | 2459-2460, 2659 | `get_obj_keeper` candidate loop lacked the ROM `can_see_obj(keeper, obj) && can_see_obj(ch, obj)` filters — a blind buyer (or an `ITEM_INVIS` item without detect-invis, or an item the keeper can't see) could be bought. The `get_obj_keeper` audit row (line 170) falsely claimed "visibility filter applied" (stale ✅). | ✅ **FIXED** — both checks gated inside the candidate loop (so the `N.name` index only counts visible items); `test_buy_blind_buyer_cannot_see_item` |
| **LIST-004** | `do_list()` | 2831 | `do_list` listing loop lacked the ROM `can_see_obj(ch, obj)` buyer-visibility filter — a blind buyer (or an `ITEM_INVIS` item without detect-invis) saw items they cannot see. Note: `do_list` checks **only** the buyer's visibility, NOT the keeper's (unlike `get_obj_keeper`). | ✅ **FIXED** — `can_see_object(char, obj)` gate added in the listing loop; `test_list_hides_items_blind_buyer_cannot_see` |
| **GETCOST-001** | `get_cost()` | 2487, 2499 | `_get_cost` read the PROTOTYPE cost (`proto.cost`) for both buy and sell sides; ROM `get_cost` uses the RUNTIME `obj->cost`. `do_buy` clamps a purchased item's `obj.cost` down to the haggled price (:2765-2766, already implemented at `shop.py:880-881`), but resale priced from `proto.cost`, ignoring the clamp — a haggle-buy-cheap/resell-dear exploit. | ✅ **FIXED** — `_get_cost` reads `obj.cost` (proto fallback) for both directions; `test_sell_uses_runtime_cost_not_prototype`. Sibling: `do_buy` haggle-discount base still reads `proto.cost` vs ROM `obj->cost` (:2727) — see BUY-009. |
| **BUY-009** | `do_buy()` | 2727 | `do_buy` buy-haggle discount base reads `proto.cost` (`base_cost = proto.cost`, `shop.py:826-830`); ROM computes `cost -= obj->cost / 2 * roll / 100` using the RUNTIME `obj->cost`. Diverges when `obj.cost != proto.cost` (e.g. re-buying a haggle-clamped item another player resold). | ✅ **FIXED** — discount base reads `obj.cost` (proto fallback); `test_buy_haggle_discount_uses_runtime_cost` |
| **BUY-010** | `do_buy()` | 2747-2748 | The keeper coin split `keeper->gold += cost*number/100; keeper->silver += cost*number - (cost*number/100)*100` used bare Python `//`/`%` (`shop.py:876-877`). When `profit_buy < 50` a winning haggle drives `cost*number` NEGATIVE (player refunded via `deduct_cost`, `src/handler.c:2410`); on a negative dividend C truncates toward zero / `%` takes the dividend sign, while Python floors / takes the divisor sign — same net wealth but a DIVERGENT gold/silver split (e.g. total −9 → ROM gold 0/silver −9, Python gold −1/silver 91). Signed-math (Layer-B) divergence. | ✅ **FIXED** — split uses `c_div`/`c_mod` (`shop.py:876-877`); `tests/test_shops.py::test_buy_negative_total_cost_keeper_split_uses_c_truncation`. |
| **SELL-005** | `do_sell()` | 2931 | The sell-haggle cap `cost = UMIN(cost, 95 * get_cost(keeper, obj, TRUE) / 100)` is UNCONDITIONAL in ROM; when the buy price is 0 (`profit_buy == 0`) it clamps the sale to 0. Python guarded the cap behind `if buy_price > 0`, leaving the full haggled price. | ✅ **FIXED** — cap applied unconditionally; `test_sell_haggle_cap_applies_when_buy_price_zero` |
| **SELL-006** | `do_sell()` | 2930 | The sell-haggle bonus `cost += obj->cost / 2 * roll / 100` (`shop.py:954`) reads `proto.cost` for its base; ROM uses the RUNTIME `obj->cost`. Sell-side mirror of BUY-009 / GETCOST-001; diverges when `obj.cost != proto.cost`. | ✅ **FIXED** — `base_cost` now reads runtime `selected_obj.cost` (`shop.py:953`). Test `tests/test_shops.py::test_sell_haggle_bonus_uses_runtime_cost` (profit_buy raised to 300 so the 95% cap at :2931 doesn't bind). |
| **GETCOST-003** | `get_cost()` | 2504 | ROM guards the keeper duplicate-stock discount loop with `if (!IS_OBJ_STAT(obj, ITEM_SELL_EXTRACT))` — an object flagged `ITEM_SELL_EXTRACT` must NOT receive the same-item discount. Python's `_get_cost` applied the dupe discount unconditionally. | ✅ **FIXED** — dupe-discount loop short-circuits when the sold object (or its proto) has `ITEM_SELL_EXTRACT` (`shop.py:477-481`); `tests/test_shops.py::test_get_cost_sell_extract_skips_dupe_discount`. |
| **GETCOST-005** | `get_cost()` | 2518-2524 | ROM's wand/staff charge scaling reads the RUNTIME `obj->value[1]`/`obj->value[2]` (max/remaining charges, depleted by use): `cost = cost * obj->value[2] / obj->value[1]`. Python's `_get_cost` reads `proto.value` (`shop.py:503`), so a partially-used wand/staff is priced at its original full-charge ratio instead of its depleted runtime ratio — the wand/staff charge mirror of the GETCOST-001 proto→runtime class. | ✅ **FIXED** — charge scaling reads runtime `obj.value` (proto fallback) (`shop.py:503-507`). `tests/test_shops.py::test_get_cost_wand_charge_scaling_uses_runtime_value`. |
| **GETCOST-004** | `get_cost()` | 2507-2508 | ROM matches a keeper duplicate with `obj->pIndexData == obj2->pIndexData && !str_cmp(obj->short_descr, obj2->short_descr)` — BOTH prototype identity AND short_descr must match. Python's predicate `op is proto OR (vnum AND descr)` short-circuits on `op is proto`, skipping the descr check. A same-prototype copy with a DIFFERENT runtime `short_descr` (per-instance customization) wrongly receives the discount. | ✅ **FIXED** — descr check now always applied (`shop.py:486-490`): `same_proto and other_descr == obj_descr`. `tests/test_shops.py::test_get_cost_dupe_discount_requires_matching_short_descr`. |
| **GETCOST-002** | `get_cost()` | 2505-2515 | ROM's same-item discount loop has **no `break`** — it iterates ALL of `keeper->carrying` and applies the discount once **per matching copy** (non-inventory dupes compound: 3 copies → `cost*3/4*3/4*3/4`; `obj_to_keeper` keeps non-inventory dupes as separate nodes, :2436-2437). Python `break`s after the first match, applying the discount only once. The `ITEM_INVENTORY` branch (`cost/=2`) cannot compound — its dedup destroys the dupe (:2421) — so only non-inventory copies are affected. | ✅ **FIXED** — removed the `break`; the discount now compounds per matching copy (`shop.py:486-491`). `tests/test_shops.py::test_get_cost_dupe_discount_compounds_per_copy`. Surfaced + fixed a latent test bug: `test_wand_staff_price_scales_with_charges_and_inventory_discount` hardcoded `1<<18` (≠ `ITEM_INVENTORY`=8192), so it never exercised the `/2` path and its expected value encoded the old single-discount behavior — corrected to the real enum + ROM-compounded value (2). |
