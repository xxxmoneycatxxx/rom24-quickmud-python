"""Canonical single-delivery message push, mirroring ROM ``write_to_buffer``.

ROM C ``src/comm.c:write_to_buffer`` writes one message to the descriptor's
output buffer — a single delivery channel.  Python cannot do synchronous
socket writes inside the synchronous game tick, so connected characters
receive messages via ``asyncio.create_task(send_to_char(...))``.  The
``char.messages`` mailbox is a fallback for tests and disconnected
characters only.

Appending to BOTH the async send and the mailbox causes duplicate
delivery: the connection read loop in ``mud/net/connection.py`` drains
``char.messages`` after every command, so any combat/magic message would
replay on the next prompt for connected PCs.

See ``docs/divergences/MESSAGE_DELIVERY.md`` for the full design rationale
and ``docs/parity/audits/DUPLICATE_IMPLEMENTATIONS.md`` (DUPL-002) for the
audit row that consolidated the divergent copies into this module.

# --- INV-053 PROMPT-AFTER-TICK-OUTPUT ----------------------------------------
# ROM `game_loop_unix` runs one output phase per pulse, AFTER `update_handler()`:
# every descriptor with buffered output (`d->outtop > 0`) gets `process_output`,
# which appends a fresh `bust_a_prompt` (src/comm.c:868-883, 1376-1377). So a
# tick-generated message (combat, a spell from a mob/mobprog, a poison affect)
# is followed by a refreshed prompt within the same pulse. The Python port pushes
# the message but rendered no trailing prompt — the HP/mana line stayed frozen
# until the player's next command. We mirror ROM by marking every PC that
# receives output *during the synchronous tick* and emitting one prompt per
# marked descriptor afterwards (`mud.net.connection.schedule_tick_prompts`).
#
# Gated to tick context: because `game_tick()` is synchronous and the event loop
# is single-threaded, anything delivered while `_in_tick` is True is exactly the
# pulse's output — command-context deliveries (socials, command responses) leave
# `_in_tick` False and never arm a prompt, so they don't double-prompt against
# the per-connection loop's own top-of-loop prompt (ROM's `fcommand` case).
