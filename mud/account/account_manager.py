"""Account manager — DB-canonical persistence (INV-008 Phase 2).

The DB row (mud.db.models.Character) is the single source of truth for ALL
player gameplay state.  The JSON pfile path (mud.persistence) has been removed.

``save_character`` writes all 71 fields to the DB row via ``save_character_to_db``.
``load_character`` queries the DB row and returns a fully-initialized runtime
Character via ``from_orm``.

ROM Reference: src/save.c fread_char / fwrite_char — the C engine's pfile is
the single source of truth; the only external auth store is the pfile itself.
Python equivalent: the DB row owns both auth and all gameplay state.

INV-003: ``character_registry`` membership is maintained — ``load_character``
appends to the registry after a successful DB load.

INV-008 (DB-CANONICAL): The invariant has been reversed — the DB row is now
the canonical source, not the JSON pfile.  There is no JSON fallback path.
