"""`rescue` must SINGLE-DELIVER each line and push them to the right channel.

FIGHT-029 / INV-001 SINGLE-DELIVERY family — the `do_rescue`/`do_surrender`
shape. ROM `do_rescue` (`src/fight.c:3089-3091`) is **void** and writes all
three success lines straight to the descriptor via `act()`:

    act ("{5You rescue $N!{x", ch, NULL, victim, TO_CHAR);   # rescuer
    act ("{5$n rescues you!{x", ch, NULL, victim, TO_VICT);  # victim
    act ("{5$n rescues $N!{x", ch, NULL, victim, TO_NOTVICT);# room

There is no return-value channel. The Python port had two distinct bugs:

1. **Rescuer double-delivery** (the `do_kill`/FIGHT-020 shape): `rescue()`
   did `caster.messages.append(char_msg)` AND `do_rescue` returned that same
   line. The connection loop (`mud/net/connection.py`) sends a command's
   return value AND drains `char.messages`, so a connected PC rescuer received
   "You rescue X!" **twice**.

2. **Victim/room wrong-channel** (the MAGIC-003 shape): the TO_VICT and
   TO_NOTVICT lines were appended to `target.messages` / `occupant.messages`
   only. `char.messages` is a fallback for disconnected chars / tests
   (`mud/utils/messaging.py`, AGENTS.md "Message Delivery"); a **connected**
   victim/bystander must receive via the async `send_to_char` push so the line
   reaches their live prompt immediately, not on their next command's drain.

A pure double-delivery count test (the kill template) catches (1) but
**false-greens on (2)** — the victim/room legs are not duplicated, just
delayed in the mailbox. So this file splits the shape: rescuer → count-once;
victim + bystander → push-present + mailbox-empty (the MAGIC-003 template).
