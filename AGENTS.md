# QuickMUD Development Guide for AI Agents

## Purpose

`rom24-quickmud-python` is a **ROM 2.4b6 → Python faithful port**. The goal is
100% behavioral parity with the original C engine, not improvement. When ROM C
behavior is "wrong" or quirky, we replicate it exactly.

The companion browser frontend lives in the sibling project
`quickmud-web-client` (`../quickmud-web-client`) and is versioned independently.

## Source of Truth

- Engine repo (this project): `https://github.com/Nostoi/rom24-quickmud-python`
- Original ROM C source: `src/` (read-only reference; do not modify)
- Frontend repo: `../quickmud-web-client`

Before changing engine behavior, read the corresponding ROM C function. Do not
guess.

## Resuming in Any Harness (Claude Code, Codex, Opencode, …)

A fresh agent can pick up this project regardless of which CLI it runs in.
Required reading order at session start:

1. `docs/sessions/SESSION_STATUS.md` — single canonical "where we are" pointer.
2. The latest `docs/sessions/SESSION_SUMMARY_*.md` it references.
3. `docs/parity/ROM_C_SUBSYSTEM_AUDIT_TRACKER.md` — pick the next ⚠️ Partial / ❌ Not Audited row.
4. The per-file audit doc for the chosen target (e.g. `docs/parity/ACT_OBJ_C_AUDIT.md`).

Workflow skills live as plain markdown in `.claude/skills/` and are readable
from any harness:

- **Claude Code agents:** invoke them via the `Skill` tool (e.g.
  `Skill({skill: "rom-parity-audit", args: "scan.c"})`). Do not read the
  SKILL.md and follow it inline — let the harness load it.
- **Codex / Opencode / other harnesses:** `Read` the SKILL.md file and
  follow the instructions manually. Same workflow, just no `Skill` tool.

- `.claude/skills/rom-parity-audit/SKILL.md` — file-level audit (5 phases).
- `.claude/skills/rom-gap-closer/SKILL.md` — single-gap TDD close (one test, one commit).
- `.claude/skills/rom-session-handoff/SKILL.md` — end-of-session SUMMARY + STATUS writer.
- `.claude/skills/gitnexus/gitnexus-cli/SKILL.md` — wraps `npx gitnexus …` with canonical flags.

GitNexus MCP must be configured per-harness for `gitnexus_impact` /
`gitnexus_detect_changes` calls to work. Without it, fall back to `grep` and
run the area-specific integration test suite to catch regressions.

## ROM Parity Rules (CRITICAL)

These are non-negotiable. Violations are bugs even if tests pass.

- **ALWAYS fix ROM-FAITHFULLY, NEVER with a quick hack.** Every fix — even a
  crash fix, even a one-liner, even a "just make the error go away" — MUST
  reproduce what the original ROM 2.4b6 C engine actually does. Before you write
  a fix, read the corresponding ROM C function and make the Python behavior match
  it. A change that merely stops an exception, silences a test, or "looks
  reasonable" is a FAILURE if it does not match ROM. This project's entire
  purpose is behavioral parity, not working software — a plausible-but-non-ROM
  fix is worse than the bug because it hides the divergence behind green tests.
  - **Anti-pattern (the AURA-001 trap):** `inventory` crashed on a broken
    `from mud.skills.registry import skill_lookup`. The quick hack — swap in a
    lookup that happens to exist so the import resolves — stops the crash but
    preserves a *non-ROM affect-list walk*. The ROM-faithful fix: read
    `format_obj_to_char` (`src/act_info.c`), see it uses `IS_AFFECTED(ch,
    AFF_DETECT_*)` (a bitfield test on `ch->affected_by`), and rewrite the helper
    to BE that bitfield test — deleting the non-ROM branch entirely.
  - **Test to the ROM contract, not to "no longer throws."** The regression test
    must assert the ROM behavior (e.g. bit set → `(Magical)` tag renders), so a
    future non-ROM "fix" that passes by accident still fails the test.
  - If ROM's behavior is genuinely unclear after reading the C, say so and ask —
    do not guess and ship a hack. "I couldn't find the ROM source, so I made it
    reasonable" is not acceptable here.

- **RNG:** use `mud.math.rng_mm.number_*`, never `random.*` in combat/affects.
- **Integer math:** use `c_div`/`c_mod` from `mud.math.c_compat` whenever an
  operand **can be negative**. ROM is C: integer division truncates toward zero
  and `%` takes the sign of the dividend, whereas Python `//` floors toward
  −∞ and `%` takes the sign of the divisor — they diverge only when a negative
  operand is involved (e.g. `alignment`, `saving_throw`, stat modifiers, any
  signed delta). Bare `//` / `%` are acceptable and widely used for provably
  non-negative operands (levels, percents, dice counts, gold splits), where they
  are bit-for-bit identical to C. When in doubt, use `c_div`/`c_mod`. This is NOT
  grep-enforceable (a blanket `//` ban would flag ~30 correct non-negative
  uses); it requires reading the operand domain — cite the ROM C line on
  signed-math sites.
- **Flag values:** use enums (`PlayerFlag.AUTOLOOT`, `WearFlag.NO_SAC`,
  `WearLocation.HOLD`, …). Never hardcode hex bit values — ROM C uses bit shifts
  and the hex you'd guess from the constant name is often wrong.
  - Wrong: `PLR_AUTOLOOT = 0x00000800`
  - Right: `PlayerFlag.AUTOLOOT`
- **Equipment lookup:** `char.equipment` is keyed STRICTLY by the integer wear
  slot — `char.equipment[int(WearLocation.HOLD)]` (IntEnum keys hash-equal to
  their int, so `char.equipment[WearLocation.HOLD]` is the same key). NEVER use a
  string slot name (`char.equipment["hold"]`, `char.equipped["held"]`) and never
  `char.carrying`. ROM keys equipment by `int iWear` (`src/handler.c:1733
  get_eq_char` loops `obj->wear_loc == iWear`); there are no string slot names in
  ROM. All write paths canonicalize: `do_wear` stores `int(wear_loc)`,
  `Character.equip_object(obj, slot)` runs `slot` through
  `mud.models.constants.canonical_wear_slot` (which accepts an int, a numeric
  string, or a legacy name like `"wield"`), and the JSON restore in `from_orm`
  coerces the str-keyed reload back to int. Readers MUST look up the int key — a
  string-literal read like `equipment.get("shield")` silently misses objects
  equipped under the canonical int key (the 2.9.87 school-light / combat-shield
  bug class). Enforced by `tests/test_equipment_key_convention.py` (grep-guard,
  same pattern as `test_rng_determinism.py`).
- **Character inventory:** `char.inventory`, not `char.carrying`.
- **Room occupants:** `room.people`, not `room.characters`.
- **Entity identity:** compare entity instances (`Character`, `MobInstance`,
  `Object`, `Room`) with `is`/`is not`, NEVER `==`/`!=`. ROM compares entities by
  **pointer**. The live runtime types — `Character` (PCs), `MobInstance` (mobs —
  `spawn_mob` returns it, NOT a `Character` subclass), `Object` (`spawn_object`),
  and `Room` (`ROOM_INDEX_DATA *`) — are all now `@dataclass(eq=False)` (INV-034,
  2.12.78–80), so `==`/`is` agree — `__eq__`/`__hash__` are identity, exactly ROM
  pointer semantics. Always use `is` regardless — it documents pointer intent, is grep-auditable, and is
  immune to a future dataclass-decorator regression.
  - Wrong: `if victim == ch:` / `if obj in ch.inventory:` to mean *this exact
    object* / `room.people.remove(target)`
  - Right: `if victim is ch:` and identity-keyed membership checks
  This is structural divergence class 6 — now **fully closed**. The root cause
  for every entity runtime type (`Character`/`MobInstance`/`Object`/`Room`, plus
  legacy `ObjectInstance` — value-equality) is **fixed and tracked ✅ ENFORCED as
  INV-034** in `docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md` (all five
  `eq=False`). Note `eq=False` does **not** propagate to sibling/subclass entity
  dataclasses — each entity runtime type needs its own `eq=False` (the
  `MobInstance`/`ObjectInstance` miss, caught post-commit by review). (Not grep-enforceable —
  `==`/`!=` can't be type-discriminated lexically; cite the ROM C pointer
  compare on identity sites, as INV-031(c) did for `is_same_group`.)
- **Comments:** reference ROM C source on parity-sensitive code, e.g.
  `# mirroring ROM src/fight.c:one_hit`.
- **No deferring.** When an audit finds a missing/partial ROM C function,
  implement it; do not mark it "P2 — optional". ROM parity gaps are always P0.
- **Integration tests are mandatory** for new parity work — they must verify
  ROM behavior, not just code coverage.

Mandatory reading before any audit or integration-test work:
[`docs/ROM_PARITY_VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md`](docs/ROM_PARITY_VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md).

### Message Delivery (Architectural Divergence)

ROM C delivers messages directly to the socket descriptor via `write_to_buffer()`
during the game tick. Python cannot do synchronous socket writes inside the
synchronous `game_tick()`.  Instead, we use `asyncio.create_task(send_to_char(...))`
for fire-and-forget delivery, matching ROM C's real-time prompt behavior.

**Messages generated during combat ticks must reach connected players
immediately.**  The `char.messages` list is a test fallback only — it must NOT
be the primary delivery mechanism for combat output.  Use `_push_message()` from
`engine.py` or `broadcast_room()` from `protocol.py`.

**NEVER deliver to a connected character via `<entity>.messages.append(...)` (or
the two-step `m = getattr(x, "messages"); m.append(...)`) directly — route through
the single-delivery chokepoint `mud.utils.messaging.push_message` (async socket
xor mailbox).** Mailbox-only delivery is invisible to an idle PC until their next
command (the SPEC-017 / tick-aggression class); dual delivery replays on the next
prompt. Enforced as a Layer-A grep-guard by
`tests/test_message_delivery_convention.py` (same pattern as
`test_equipment_key_convention.py`): genuine chokepoints are allowlisted, known
unmigrated bypasses are frozen as INV-001 debt and burned down over time.

Full rationale: [`docs/divergences/MESSAGE_DELIVERY.md`](docs/divergences/MESSAGE_DELIVERY.md).

### Cross-File Invariants

The per-file audit (`/rom-parity-audit`) checks one ROM C file
against its Python equivalent function-by-function. That methodology
is necessary but **not sufficient** — it misses contracts that span
modules: single-delivery of messages, `character_registry`
membership, prompt-render-after-`raw_kill` ordering, and so on. Three
production bugs shipped this year against files marked ≥95% audited
because the broken contract lived in code outside the audited file.

**ALWAYS re-verify a written ✅ / status / "verified-as-of-vX" claim — in an
audit doc, tracker row, or load-bearing warning — against the ROM C source (or
an empirical run on the *installed* tool version) before relying on or relaying
it. A ✅ records when someone last checked, not that it is still true.**
Anti-pattern: relaying "the audit says X is ROM-correct" or "the warning says
tool Y is broken" without re-checking source/version. Three 2026-05-31 bugs
traced to stale doc claims — CAST-008 (hidden behind a `do_cast` "immediately
deducted mana" audit note), NANNY-015/TRAIN-002 (false-✅ audit rows asserting
the buggy behavior was ROM-correct), and the GitNexus 32 KB warning (stale since
1.6.5). All four were caught by reading ROM C / an empirical run, not the docs.

These contracts are tracked in
[`docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md`](docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md)
with stable IDs (INV-NNN) and one enforcement test each.

**When you audit, close, or extend a file:**

1. Skim the cross-file tracker. If any INV touches the surface you're
   working on, run its enforcement test before claiming the work done.
2. If the gap you fix touches code in a different module than the
   audit's "primary" Python file, add a line to the relevant INV's
   "Touched by" trail in the tracker so the call chain stays visible.
3. If a NEW invariant surfaces (root cause of a bug crosses files),
   add the next free INV-NNN with: name, ROM mechanism, Python
   enforcement point, regression test, status. Keep the list small —
   if it grows past ~20 entries, the per-file methodology itself
   needs revisiting.

**When the cross-file invariants pass is the active mode**: when
`docs/parity/ROM_C_SUBSYSTEM_AUDIT_TRACKER.md` has no ⚠️ Partial /
❌ Not Audited rows (current state — all P0/P1/P2 at 100%, P3 at 75%
+ 3 N/A), the per-file audit default is exhausted and **cross-file
invariants becomes the primary pass**. Method: pick a candidate area
not yet covered by an INV row (affect ticks, position transitions,
mob script triggers, group/follower chain are current candidates),
run a 5-minute probe (read ROM C contract → read Python equivalent →
write one failing test for the contract), then either close as a
gap (single commit) or file as the next free INV-NNN. The probe-
then-scope pattern is faster than full audit phases when you're
hunting for divergences vs cataloguing them — the 2.9.3–2.9.6
session (INV-014 + INV-013 carrier-field sweep + decay-loop
coverage) is the worked example.

The point is not to re-audit every file under the new lens; it's to
enumerate the contracts once, lock each one with a test, and
reference those tests from the per-file rows. The
`/rom-parity-audit` skill's Phase 2 calls this out explicitly.

### Completeness lens & verification epistemics

The per-file audit and the cross-INV process answer "is *this*
function/contract correct?" They do **not** answer "how close to done
are we, and how would we know?" That question has a tractable
reformulation: ROM↔Python parity risk only exists where the two
engines **diverge structurally** (sync vs async, pointer vs GC
identity, array vs dict, C-int vs Python-int, static-buffer reuse,
fread parsing). That set of **divergence classes** is small (~11) and
enumerable, and each class has a single correct verification *layer*.
The roster is
[`docs/parity/DIVERGENCE_CLASS_ROSTER.md`](docs/parity/DIVERGENCE_CLASS_ROSTER.md);
run a sweep via `/rom-divergence-sweep`.

This lens **contains** the existing processes, it does not replace
them: the grep-guards (`test_rng_determinism.py`,
`test_equipment_key_convention.py`, `test_attribute_convention.py`)
are its **Layer A** (static bypass-guards); the cross-INV process is
its **Layer C** (ordering/lifecycle, no chokepoint); signed-math is
**Layer B** (domain-conditional, human-read). Keep using cross-INV,
`/rom-gap-closer`, and `/rom-parity-audit` — the roster just routes
work into them.

Four guardrails — learned the hard way, durable on purpose:

1. **Durable surfaces hold method; trackers hold status.** Never write
   a number, a ✅, or "class X is clean" into AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md /
   a SKILL.md. Status goes in the roster / INV trackers (which are
   expected to rot and be re-verified on read).
2. **A committed guard beats a doc-✅.** A `rglob → forbid-pattern →
   assert` test is self-maintaining; a tracker note rots. Prefer
   turning a verified contract into a test over writing "verified."
3. **The roster is enumeration-dependent — blind to classes nobody
   named.** The only enumeration-*independent* check is differential
   execution (`tools/diff_harness/`). Therefore **"close on the known
   surface" ≠ "close to ROM parity"** — never blur the two.
4. **Re-verify any ✅/status claim against ROM C source (or an
   empirical run on the installed tool) before relying on or relaying
   it** — reinforcing the rule above; a recall oracle (re-deriving a
   known-open item) is how you prove a sweep has recall before
   trusting its silence.

## Build / Lint / Test

```bash
# NOTE: run these from the project virtualenv — `.venv/bin/python -m pytest`,
# `.venv/bin/ruff`, etc. (or `source .venv/bin/activate` first). The bare
# commands below assume an activated .venv. See "Environment" below for why the
# system Python is unsafe here.

# All tests — runs in parallel by default (-n auto --dist loadscope via
# pyproject addopts); ~94s on a 10-core machine (~517s serial). A per-test
# --timeout=120 hang-guard is also applied (see "Hang-guard" below).
pytest

# Single-test debugging — disable parallelism for readable output / pdb:
pytest -n0 tests/test_foo.py::test_bar

# Integration tests
pytest tests/integration/ -v

# Coverage gate (CI requires ≥80%)
pytest --cov=mud --cov-report=term --cov-fail-under=80

# Lint / format

ruff format --check .

# Type check (strict on selected modules)
mypy mud/net/ansi.py mud/security/hash_utils.py --follow-imports=skip

# Comprehensive command registration check

```

Three test layers — unit (`tests/test_*.py`), integration
(`tests/integration/`), and command-registry (`test_all_commands.py`). Run all
three when adding commands.

### Environment: ALWAYS run in the project virtualenv (`.venv`)

**Run every `pytest` / `ruff` / `mypy` invocation from `.venv`, not the system /
framework Python.** This machine's global framework Python is shared across
multiple projects whose dependency pins are **mutually incompatible** — a real
example that bit us (2026-07-04): `fastapi 0.116.1` and `gradio` require
`starlette < 1.0`, while `sse-starlette` requires `starlette >= 0.49.1`. **No
single global `starlette` version satisfies all of them.** When the global env
drifted to `starlette 1.3.1`, `FastAPI(lifespan=…)` began passing `on_startup=`
to a `Router.__init__()` that no longer accepts it, and **4 web/session test
files died at collection** (`TypeError: Router.__init__() got an unexpected
keyword argument 'on_startup'` — `test_websocket_server.py`,
`test_prompt_cmd_parity.py`, `test_inv009_registry_disconnect_cleanup.py`,
`test_nanny_saveload_runtime_path.py`), silently dropping ~18 tests. The project's
own pins (`requirements*.txt`, `pyproject`) are correct and internally consistent
(`fastapi 0.116.1` + `starlette 0.47.3`); only the *shared global env* was wrong.

**Durable fix — one-time setup:**

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv                             # .venv/ is gitignored
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -U pip
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt   # pinned, reproducible lock
```

`mud` is imported from the repo root (tests run from there), so the lock — which
installs deps only, not the package — is sufficient; no `pip install -e .` needed.
`pip install -e ".[dev]"` also works (unpinned floors from `pyproject`'s `[dev]`
extra + editable install) if you prefer.

Then use it for every run:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest                # NOT `pytest` / `python3 -m pytest`
.venv/bin/python -m pytest -n0 tests/test_foo.py::test_bar
.venv/bin/ruff check .
```

(Or `source .venv/bin/activate` once per shell, then the bare commands work.)

**Editing dependencies:** `requirements-dev.txt` is a pip-compiled lock — edit
`requirements-dev.in` (which itself pulls in `requirements.in`), then regenerate
with pip-tools (`.venv/bin/python -m pip install pip-tools` once):
`.venv/bin/pip-compile --output-file=requirements-dev.txt requirements-dev.in`
(without `--upgrade`, so existing pins are preserved and only the delta resolves).
The lock now includes the test plugins (`pytest-xdist`, `pytest-timeout`,
`hypothesis`) the default `addopts` needs — a fresh `pip install -r
requirements-dev.txt` yields a runnable suite. Keep `requirements-dev.in`,
`requirements.in`, and `pyproject`'s `[dev]` extra in agreement when you touch deps.

### Hang-guard: `--timeout` in the default addopts

`pyproject`'s `addopts` includes `--timeout=120 --timeout-method=thread`
(pytest-timeout). No legitimate test runs near 120s (full suite ~171s), so it
only fires on a genuine **per-test** hang — turning an indefinite stall into a
failure-with-stack-dump. It does **not** fix the separate, intermittent xdist
**sessionfinish** teardown flake (a worker IPC "cannot send" / hang at the very
end of a full parallel run); that is environmental and harmless — all tests have
already run and reported by then. If a full-suite summary line fails to flush,
it's that teardown flake, not a test failure: re-run, or trust the `0 failed`
from the progress stream. Disable the guard with `--timeout=0`; override per test
with `@pytest.mark.timeout(n)`.

### Differential testing harness (`tools/diff_harness/`)

A fourth, complementary verification layer: it runs the **original ROM 2.4b6 C
engine** and the Python port through identical scripted scenarios and diffs
observable state + output, so parity divergences surface mechanically instead of
relying on hand-written assertions. Full docs: `tools/diff_harness/README.md`;
open divergences: `tools/diff_harness/FINDINGS.md`.

**When to use it:**

- You changed an engine surface covered by a scenario (movement/get-drop,
  affect_armor, combat_melee_rounds, spell_combat) — run the replay to confirm
  you didn't drift from ROM.
- You're hunting a subtle parity divergence and want C ground truth rather than a
  Python-authored expectation. Author a new scenario (see below) to capture it.
- Before claiming a parity gap closed on a surface the harness can exercise.

**How to use it:**

- **Everyday replay (no C build):** `pytest tests/test_differential_smoke.py
  tests/test_diff_harness_unit.py`. Replays pure-Python against the committed
  goldens in `tests/data/golden/diff/`. A missing golden skips; a known,
  not-yet-resolved divergence xfails (`KNOWN_DIVERGENCES` in the replay test).
- **Author a scenario:** drop `tools/diff_harness/scenarios/<name>.json`
  (`name`, `seed`, `start_room`, `char`, `watch` set, `steps`). A snapshot over
  the watch-set is auto-inserted after every step. v1 is a deterministic no-RNG
  slice (look/movement/get-drop/inventory/wear-remove).
- **Regenerate/verify goldens (needs the instrumented C binary):**
  `cd src && make -f Makefile.diffshim diffshim` (one-time, additive — ROM
  `src/*.c` stay byte-for-byte unchanged), then
  `python3 -m tools.diff_harness.capture --all` (regenerate) or `--check`
  (CI-style diff vs committed). Goldens are stamped with the repo HEAD sha +
  build flags + seed; the trace is C-engine output (immutable unless ROM C or a
  scenario changes), so a regen typically only refreshes the provenance stamp.

**A divergence is a finding, not a golden to overwrite.** ROM is the source of
truth: when replay fails on a real divergence, triage it, record it in
`FINDINGS.md`, file a parity gap (per the routing table below), and fix Python
or the data — never edit the golden to make the test pass.

### Test fixtures (from `conftest.py`)

```python
movable_char_factory(name, room_vnum, points=100)
movable_mob_factory(vnum, room_vnum, points=100)
object_factory(proto_kwargs)
place_object_factory(room_vnum, vnum=..., proto_kwargs=...)
portal_factory(room_vnum, to_vnum, closed=False)
ensure_can_move(entity, points=100)
```

Note: `Object.__post_init__` does **not** auto-sync `value` from the prototype.
Test fixtures must do `obj.value = list(proto.value)` after construction.

### Test determinism (RNG)

The Mitchell-Moore RNG (`mud.utils.rng_mm`) is **global mutable state**, so
RNG-dependent tests are flaky if state leaks across test boundaries.

- `tests/integration/conftest.py` has an autouse fixture that calls
  `rng_mm.seed_mm(12345)` before every integration test. Do **not** remove it.
  Without it, tests that depend on probabilistic outcomes (scavenger acts on
  a 1/64 roll, AoE saves, holy_word damage rolls, combat hit/miss) flake on
  ordering. This was added in v2.6.2 — see CHANGELOG.
- If your test needs a specific RNG sequence, call `rng_mm.seed_mm(<seed>)`
  inside the test (after fixture setup) — that overrides the autouse default.
- Never use `random.*` in production code or in tests that are checking ROM
  parity. Use `rng_mm.number_*` so the seed actually controls behavior.
- Don't write a new test that "just runs more iterations until something
  happens" without seeding. That's a flake waiting to surface in CI.

A test asserting a behavior that contradicts ROM C is a bug in the **test**,
not in the implementation. ROM is the source of truth. When a test fails:
read the corresponding ROM C function before assuming the Python code is
wrong. (Example: `test_giant_strength_refuses_to_stack` was originally
`test_stat_modifiers_stack_from_same_spell` — the test asserted stacking,
but ROM `magic.c:3022-3030` explicitly anti-stacks.)

### Parallel test execution & isolation

The suite runs in parallel by default — `pyproject.toml` sets
`addopts = "-n auto --dist loadscope"` (pytest-xdist). ~94s vs ~517s serial.

```bash
pytest                              # all tests, parallel (default)
pytest -n0                          # force serial (debugging, pdb, readable output)
pytest -n0 tests/test_foo.py::bar   # one test, serial
pytest tests/integration/ -v        # a subdir, still parallel
```

`--dist loadscope` keeps every test in a module/class on **one** worker, so
module-scoped fixtures and intra-file ordering behave exactly as in a serial
run. What it does **not** protect against is **cross-file shared state**:
xdist workers are separate processes, so they only share the **filesystem,
network ports, and global singletons that persist within a worker across the
multiple files assigned to it**. When you add or touch a test, keep it
parallel-safe:

- **Never depend on global state another test file sets up.** A test must pass
  when run alone (`pytest -n0 path::test`). If it only passes in the full
  suite, it has a hidden cross-file dependency (e.g. `time_info.sunlight` left
  at daytime, a populated `area_registry`, a seeded DB schema). Set up what you
  need locally instead.
- **Reset global mutable singletons you mutate** — `area_registry`,
  `character_registry`, `mud.registry.descriptor_list`, `time_info`,
  `object_registry`. Snapshot/clear/restore in an autouse fixture (see
  `tests/conftest.py` `_reset_object_registry` / `_reset_descriptor_list` for
  the pattern). A test that leaves a registry dirty breaks whatever lands next
  on the same worker.
- **Per-worker resources for anything on disk or a port.** The shared SQLite
  engine (`mud/db/session.py`, fixed `sqlite:///mud.db`) is isolated by
  `tests/conftest.py` setting a per-worker `DATABASE_URL` from
  `PYTEST_XDIST_WORKER`. If you add a test that binds a port or writes a fixed
  file, namespace it by `worker_id` / `PYTEST_XDIST_WORKER` (or use `tmp_path`).
- **Diagnosing an xdist-only failure:** run the file alone (`-n0`). Passes
  alone but fails parallel → your test leaks OR a sibling leaks into it (reset
  the singleton). Fails alone too → it depends on cross-file setup (make it
  self-contained). Worker grouping shifts between runs, so a different latent
  leak can surface each run — fix the root cause, don't just re-run.

## Code Style

- `from __future__ import annotations` first; stdlib / third-party / local.
- Strict type annotations; `TYPE_CHECKING` guard for circular imports.
- `snake_case` functions/vars, `PascalCase` classes, `UPPER_CASE` constants,
  `_prefix` private.
- Public functions have docstrings; parity-sensitive code cites ROM C source.
- Line length 120, double quotes, 4-space indent (ruff/black).

## Trackers (single source of truth — do not duplicate status into AGENTS.md)

| File | Purpose | When to update |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `docs/parity/ROM_C_SUBSYSTEM_AUDIT_TRACKER.md` | Per-file ROM C audit status (43 files) | Any audit work |
| `docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md` | Cross-module contracts (INV-NNN: SINGLE-DELIVERY, REGISTRY-MEMBERSHIP, PROMPT-CLAMP, …) — what per-file audits miss | Whenever a bug's root cause crosses module boundaries, or when an audit touches a file referenced by an INV |
| `docs/parity/INTEGRATION_TEST_COVERAGE_TRACKER.md` | Coverage of 21 gameplay systems | Adding integration tests |
| `docs/parity/ROM_PARITY_FEATURE_TRACKER.md` | Feature-level parity backlog | Implementing parity features |
| `docs/parity/ACT_OBJ_C_AUDIT.md`, `ACT_INFO_C_AUDIT.md`, etc. | Per-file gap tables (GET-001, PUT-002, …) | Closing specific gaps |
| `PROJECT_COMPLETION_STATUS.md` | Subsystem confidence scores | After major subsystem work |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | User-visible / dev-visible change log | Every push (see Repo Hygiene) |

`TODO.md` and `ARCHITECTURAL_TASKS.md` are historical and complete — do not
update them.

For the audit methodology itself (5 phases, ROM-C → audit doc → implementation
→ integration tests → completion), see
[`docs/ROM_PARITY_VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md`](docs/ROM_PARITY_VERIFICATION_GUIDE.md).

### Out-of-scope bugs surfaced mid-audit (file durably, do not just mention)

Bugs discovered while reading code for an audit or gap-closer — but that
are NOT the gap you're closing — must be filed durably **before** moving
on. Chat-only mentions evaporate at session end and have caused real
regressions to ship.

Routing by bug shape:

| Bug shape | File where |
|-----------|-----------|
| Cross-file / cross-module contract violation (root cause spans files) | New `INV-NNN` row in `docs/parity/CROSS_FILE_INVARIANTS_TRACKER.md`. Use next free ID; check the table for the current max — IDs are non-contiguous because of retirements. |
| Local divergence in a single function (typo, wrong constant, missing branch) | Per-file `docs/parity/<FILE>_C_AUDIT.md` with a stable ID matching the file's pattern (e.g. `MLOAD-001`, `OLOAD-002`). |
| Blocks a different audit's gap closure | Annotate the blocked row's status to `⚠️ BLOCKED` and reference the new bug ID under "Notes". Add a short "Blocked rows" subsection at the bottom of the audit doc if the file doesn't already have one. |
| Generic feature gap / missing helper | `docs/parity/ROM_PARITY_FEATURE_TRACKER.md`. |

Then surface it in this session's `SESSION_SUMMARY_*.md` "Outstanding"
section so the next agent sees the new ID without having to re-discover it.

A verbal mention to the user is not filing. The chat transcript is not
durable workflow state — the trackers are.

## Session Notes

Per-session work logs live under **`docs/sessions/`**. AGENTS.md itself does
**not** carry a running session narrative — keep it stable.

### Conventions

- **Filename:** `SESSION_SUMMARY_YYYY-MM-DD_<short-topic>.md`. Multi-session
  days get distinct topics (`..._ACT_MOVE_COMPLETE.md`,
  `..._ACT_OBJ_C_AUDIT_PHASES_1-4.md`).
- **Handoff documents** (when a session ends mid-stream and another agent
  picks up): `HANDOFF_YYYY-MM-DD_<topic>.md`, also under `docs/sessions/`.
- **Single canonical "current" pointer:** `docs/sessions/SESSION_STATUS.md`
  always reflects the latest state. Newer sessions overwrite it; the old
  contents are preserved in the dated `SESSION_SUMMARY_*.md` for that session.

### Workflow

1. **Start of session:** read `docs/sessions/SESSION_STATUS.md` and the most
   recent `SESSION_SUMMARY_*.md` for context. Skim the relevant tracker docs
   for the active audit.
2. **During session:** keep work-in-progress notes wherever you like, but do
   not commit transient scratch files to the repo root.
3. **End of session:** create `docs/sessions/SESSION_SUMMARY_<date>_<topic>.md`
   summarizing what landed (gaps closed, files touched, tests added). Update
   `docs/sessions/SESSION_STATUS.md` to point at the new summary and state the
   next intended task.
4. **Do not** add session logs to AGENTS.md, README.md, or CHANGELOG.md. Those
   are stable surfaces; sessions are an append-only log.

If you find new `SESSION_SUMMARY_*.md` or `HANDOFF_*.md` files at the repo
root, move them into `docs/sessions/` as part of repo hygiene.

## Repo Hygiene

Before pushing changes:

1. **Update `CHANGELOG.md`**
   - Add an entry under `## [Unreleased]` (or the next version section).
   - Format: Keep a Changelog (`Added` / `Changed` / `Fixed` / `Removed`).
   - Summarize user-visible behavior, dev-workflow changes, and important
     fixes — not internal refactors.

2. **Update `README.md` when needed**
   - Setup, usage, architecture, command-parity claims, badges, or test
     counts that changed.
   - Keep ROM-parity status badges honest. Do not claim percentages the
     trackers don't support.
   - **Whenever you touch README's "Project Status" / badges / metrics, also
     refresh AGENTS.md's tracker pointers and `docs/sessions/SESSION_STATUS.md`
     in the same commit so the three surfaces (README, AGENTS, SESSION_STATUS)
     never disagree.** Source of truth for the underlying numbers stays in
     `docs/parity/*` trackers — do not invent figures the trackers don't back.

3. **Update the version**
   - Single source: `pyproject.toml` `version = "X.Y.Z"`.
   - Bump on any branch push, PR update, or `master` push intended to be
     shared remotely. Use semver:
     - **patch** — fixes, docs, parity gap closures with no API surface change
     - **minor** — new commands, new gameplay features, new test infrastructure
     - **major** — breaking protocol/save-format/data-model changes
   - Keep the version bump in the same commit/PR as the related code and
     changelog entries.

4. **PR and `master` hygiene**
   - **Before opening or updating a PR:** bump `pyproject.toml` version,
     update `CHANGELOG.md`, update `README.md` if setup/workflow/parity
     status changed.
   - **Before merging or pushing to `master`:**
     - confirm `pyproject.toml` version reflects the full state being merged
     - confirm `CHANGELOG.md` describes the shipped behavior
     - confirm `README.md` still matches current setup and parity status
     - confirm `docs/sessions/SESSION_STATUS.md` is current
   - Treat `master` as the publish-ready branch. Do not push stale versions
     or stale changelog entries to `master`.

5. **Verify**
   - `pytest` passes (or the only failures are the documented pre-existing ones).
   - `ruff check .` clean.
   - For integration-test or audit work, update the relevant tracker doc.
   - Run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing (see GitNexus section).

## Specialized Agent Files

| File | Use when |
|------|----------|
| [`AGENT.md`](AGENT.md) | Architectural integration analysis (subsystem confidence < 0.92) |
| [`AGENT.EXECUTOR.md`](AGENT.EXECUTOR.md) | Executing tasks already defined by AGENT.md |
| ~~`FUNCTION_COMPLETION_AGENT.md`~~ | Removed — task subsumed by `/rom-gap-closer` workflow |

---

## Autonomous Mode

When the user explicitly says "auto mode" or "complete all tasks":

1. Build a todo list from the relevant tracker docs.
2. Execute sequentially without per-step approval; fix errors immediately.
3. Run `pytest` after each major task; do not proceed past a regression.
4. Update tracker docs and `docs/sessions/SESSION_STATUS.md` as you go.
5. Stop on time limit, scope completion, or unrecoverable error after 3 fix
   attempts.

Auto mode is not a license for destructive operations (force pushes, history
rewrites, dropping data). Those still need explicit confirmation.

## GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **rom24-quickmud-python** (33 200
symbols, 54 952 relationships, 300 execution flows). If any GitNexus tool
warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` first.

**Use the `gitnexus-cli` skill for any GitNexus CLI invocation** (analyze,
status, clean, wiki, list). Do not call `npx gitnexus …` raw — invoke
`Skill({skill: "gitnexus-cli", args: "<intent>"})` so the canonical flags
(e.g. `--skip-agents-md` to preserve the auto-managed CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md
block) are applied.

### Always Do

- **Run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a
  function, class, or method, run
  `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report
  blast radius (callers, affected processes, risk) to the user.
- **Run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes
  only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **Warn the user** on HIGH/CRITICAL risk before proceeding.
- For unfamiliar code, prefer `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` over grep.
- For full context on a symbol (callers, callees, flows), use
  `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.

### Never Do

- Edit a function/class/method without first running `gitnexus_impact`.
- Ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings.
- Rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `gitnexus_rename`.
- Commit without running `gitnexus_detect_changes()`.

# GitNexus — Code Intelligence

This project is indexed by GitNexus as **rom24-quickmud-python** (39196 symbols, 65340 relationships, 300 execution flows). Use the GitNexus MCP tools to understand code, assess impact, and navigate safely.

> If any GitNexus tool warns the index is stale, run `npx gitnexus analyze` in terminal first.

## Always Do

- **MUST run impact analysis before editing any symbol.** Before modifying a function, class, or method, run `gitnexus_impact({target: "symbolName", direction: "upstream"})` and report the blast radius (direct callers, affected processes, risk level) to the user.
- **MUST run `gitnexus_detect_changes()` before committing** to verify your changes only affect expected symbols and execution flows.
- **MUST warn the user** if impact analysis returns HIGH or CRITICAL risk before proceeding with edits.
- When exploring unfamiliar code, use `gitnexus_query({query: "concept"})` to find execution flows instead of grepping. It returns process-grouped results ranked by relevance.
- When you need full context on a specific symbol — callers, callees, which execution flows it participates in — use `gitnexus_context({name: "symbolName"})`.

## Never Do

- NEVER edit a function, class, or method without first running `gitnexus_impact` on it.
- NEVER ignore HIGH or CRITICAL risk warnings from impact analysis.
- NEVER rename symbols with find-and-replace — use `gitnexus_rename` which understands the call graph.
- NEVER commit changes without running `gitnexus_detect_changes()` to check affected scope.
